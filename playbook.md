# Accountability when working together

Following a group consent decision-making process, the guideline below passed with no objections on December 15th 2022.

(*) [Original Blogpost Proposal](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/accountability-when-working-together-proposal-for-consent-194007)

## 1. Purpose.

To establish a **baseline of behaviors and mutual expectations for a project team** (or group working together), in order to distribute **accountability** and **leadership** across the organization, strengthen our **culture** (One Team, SMO), improve our **performance**, and develop a spirit of **excellence** in everything we do.

-   *What does accountability mean in the context of Vizz?*
    
-   *Are people on the same page regarding what they are accountable for?*
    
-   *How might we improve our accountability as a team?*
    
These agreements represent a **shared language** that everyone can understand and refer to around accountability, what we owe to each other, and what teamwork looks like.

## 2. Our Accountability Agreements.

Ideas are organized into two main categories, what accountability is in terms of **mindset** and the **behaviors** that contribute to it.

**2.1. Mindset “*Accountability is …* ”**

- To have in mind our *individual impact on the collective* and the rest of the company.
- An attitude, and *everyone* regardless of their seniority or length in the company *can demonstrate individual leadership and accountability*. 
- To *care* for yourself, your work, and your peers, in order to create a healthy work environment

 **2.2. Behaviors “*I am accountable for…*”**

**a. Defining and sharing my commitments**: I will define my commitments when starting a new project/initiative and share them with the team to provide clear expectations from the beginning. I will be realistic and not overpromise. If I consider we don’t have clear commitments, I will share it with the team.

**b. Delivering what I committed to:** I will fulfil in the best possible way my commitments to the team (ie. pledges, Jira tasks, deadlines, roles, etc.), managing my tasks and time effectively

**c. Sharing information and expectations:** I will provide ongoing updates to the team regarding my progress, share information that could be relevant to others, and promptly let the team know if something initially agreed upon changes. If in doubt, I will share it.

**d. Speaking up and raising issues:** I will communicate quickly to the team if something outside of my control risks my commitments, and ask for help if anything related to my commitments is ambiguous or confusing to the point that the way forward is unclear. I will flag up as soon as possible if I have too many things on my plate or competing priorities.

**e. Asking for feedback and using it to improve:** I will explicitly ask others for feedback about my work (i.e. “*what’s one thing I could improve next time?*”), and take ownership to improve based on that feedback (and my own self-reflection process). Throughout the project life cycle I will help the team identify gaps/breaks in our collective accountability.

**f. Giving feedback and holding others accountable:** I will make feedback a priority and dedicate time to [prepare for it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wPvq9-_owRBl1oiwkZwODa8ZixG7OG8a4Zrvomh4_fA/edit), with the intent of helping the team succeed. I will provide feedback to someone on the team who doesn't keep their commitments with the intention of addressing the impact of their behavior, suggesting changes, and helping the person grow. If the behavior continues, I will call the team together to discuss solutions. I will recognize others for keeping their commitments to the team.

  

## 3. How we will use these agreements?

The proposal includes **actions at 3 levels (Project, Growth, Resources)** . The intention is to keep the conversation about accountability always open and use these agreements to continue doing great work.

**a) Project (Collective): We will use our new agreements during key moments of the project life cycle.**

-   **Project managers** will make sure we have “formal and periodic” spaces to talk about accountability throughout the project (ie. Project Kick-Off, Sprint reviews, Dailies, One to One conversations, and Retrospectives).
    
-   **Project team members** will make sure to actively participate in these spaces and conversations, as well as to uphold these agreements in more “informal” spaces throughout the project which are not led by a PM. (ie. share the outcomes of conversations with partners and internal meetings, communicate updates from FA if relevant to the project, etc.)

**b) Growth (Individual): You can use the agreements individually to assess how you are being accountable at any given time, and also to identify areas to improve your accountability.**

We believe everyone can demonstrate individual leadership and accountability. As you can see, these agreements are written to be personal accountabilities first and foremost so you can use them to self reflect about your performance and added value to the team:

-   *Did I define and share my commitments?*
-   *Did I deliver what I committed to?*
-   *Did I share information and expectations?*
-   *Did I speak up and raise issues?*
-   *Did I ask for feedback and use it to improve?*
-   *Did I give feedback to others?*
    
**c) Resources: We will also add these agreements to project documentation for easy access and reference.**

  **(*) Timelines.** We will start embedding and implementing these new agreements in January 2023, and will do a retrospective after 3 months to see what needs to be improved.

# Absences

Everyone affected by your absence needs to be able to easily understand your and others' availability. This is done by using tools which allow to record and access this information in one place.

The company-wide tool for requesting absences is Bamboo. Aim to give as much notice for your absence as you reasonably can, as a rule of thumb: two weeks if you're away for less than two weeks, a month if longer.

Currently we don't have a company-wide standard of recording limited availability due to travel, participation in workshops or events. We would like to propose one company standard, and two additional extras if this fits within your workflow. 

## Company Standard: Bamboo "unavailable" option

We already record all vacation absences in Bamboo. The who's out Calendar in Bamboo also lets you see, across the whole team, when people have planned abscences. You can use the iCal feed to import this list into Google Calendar, if you like to see it there too. 

We'd also like to extend that to help us record other absences. If you are going to be working but mostly unavailable because you are travelling, in a client sprint or in a conference, please use the "unavailable" option in Bamboo to set those dates in advance. The process is the same as with time off requests.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1506306/42953516-eca834dc-8b7a-11e8-9d2d-1e897298be9c.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1506306/42953576-0b67b758-8b7b-11e8-9a01-0eb37edfbb48.png)

Please note that the absences are not pulled through in the iCal feed: always use Bamboo as the primary source of who's in and who's out. 

## Optional extra: Teamweek

In some projects we use Teamweek to plan our work for weeks or months at a time. For these staff involved in planning, it can be useful that you also record your absences in Teamweek too. You can use the "holiday" or "maternal/parental leave" project. If your absence is related to a specific project workshop or meeting, add the words "unavailable" into the task description (+ allocate 8 hours a day to the task) so people can differentiate it from regular project work. For non-project absences not covered by the above, you can create a new project; again, make sure to label it as unavailable time. This is visible in the timeline in the same way as your project assignments.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/134055/43245679-11a73f22-90a7-11e8-9e56-5ef4e99d13ac.png)

If your team is not using Teamweek for the projects you're working on, please don't feel like you have to use this. 

## Optional Extra: Google Calendar Out of Office

Many of our clients use Calendar applications to arrange meetings or events. Using the Out of Office feature in Google Calendar can help improve the visibility of your absence to them when they arrange meetings.  

When you mark yourself as Out of Office using Google Calendar, whenever anyone is booking a meeting with you when you are out, they will get an automatic reply telling them you are on not available. Where colleagues or clients have access to view your calendar, they can automatically see that you are unavailable.

You can set this up by choosing the "out of office" option when creating a new event. Select the start/ end dates and write a decline message explaining when you will be back. 

# **Adding Google Analytics**

- Step 1 - decide if we’re creating a new analytics account or using an existing account held by client.
- Step 2a - if create new, get someone to set up and provide tracking code (doesn't have to be Jamie - we all have analytics accounts with our Vizzuality email address!)
- Step 2b - if use existing, get the tracking code and install on the site
- Step 3 - invite relevant people from vizz (definitely Martin and Jamie)/ client to the account so they can access the data
- Step 4 - think through custom events you want to track (GA tracks pages by standard, but not button clicks etc)

For an example of the custom, [take a look at this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bpUlD7lAp5LpTzemAUkloLodiypQjTYWfDqiWerkVHE/edit#gid=0) we put together for Global Forest Watch country pages

# Ambassadors Guidlines

## Role of Ambassadors

What do they do?

- Model good feedback processes
- Prompt feedback
- Focus on giving quality feedback to 3 individuals per week
- Support actioning

Who can/should be a Champion?

- In theory, eventually everyone! Initally need someone from each functional group.
- Different champions can fulfill different aspects of the role

*More coming soon!*

#**Being a great buddy**

You should be assigned to your buddy by the team who hired that person the week before they arrive. Ideally you would work in a similar role to the new starter, so you can provide support at work and getting all the different systems to setup. 

You (and they) will receive tasks to complete via Bamboo; make sure to tick them off once you complete them!

Before their first day, try to link up with the team they'll work in and make sure they have work to do in the first week. Here's a few things you should do in the first day and first week to make sure our new friend gets up to speed as soon as possible:

- give them a tour of the office: toilets, fridge, coffee machine, re-stocking everything
- Give the new one an awesome t-shirt!!
- introduce them to everyone on slack
- take them for lunch as much as possible in the first week so they get to know everyone
- Make sure they read these guidelines!
- Point them to the intranet pages about their projects/ the company
- show them our vizzuality spotify playlist and suggest they join #music if they like music


# **Benefits**

Our benefits are part of a great career opportunity with the potential for you to grow and work in something with a massive transformational purpose.

## 1. Wellbeing & Paid Time Off.


 We strongly believe in the importance of wellbeing, leisure and rest, as well as having a good integration between *time to work and time for everything else*. We also believe that more time off will improve Vizzuality as a whole because people will be more productive and will have a better quality of life.

-   **26 Days** (plus your local bank holidays)
    
-   **1 extra day** for your birthday
    
-   Additional “[Sustainable Travel Days](https://github.com/Vizzuality/playbook/blob/master/guidelines/paid-journey-days.md)” to **encourage greener modes of transportation**
    
-   When you get to complete **5 years** working at Vizz, we will be recognising this important milestone, and we will add **3 more days** to your holiday allowance...forever.
    

  



## 2. Growth.



  

Growth is what keeps organisms alive. Growth is vital to any organization committed to improving itself. Without growth and the development of the individual, there will be no development of the organization.

  

-   **Training allowance of 1500 €/year** for courses, workshops, conferences, volunteering, innovation and creativity projects, or meetups of your choice, including travel and lodging. ([More information](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/guidelines/training-budget-2021.html))
    
-   When you reach **10 years at Vizz you will get a “4 Weeks Paid Sabbatical”**. A sabbatical leave at Vizzuality is “a break from work” for you to grow and develop, and it will be granted to people after they complete 10 years working at Vizzuality as a way of recognising this important milestone in their career and in the organisation.
    
-   **Free** English & Spanish Lessons
    
-   **Peer mentoring** plus the **freedom to design a career path** that suits your interests and growth needs.
    
-   **Support** for giving talks, contributing to open source projects, and to give/receive internal training
    

  



## 3. Bonus.



-   Annual profit sharing bonus plan. **Team bonus up to 10% of the salary** depending on the company's performance.
    
-   **1000 Eur Referral Bonus.** If you bring someone you know to the team and we hire them you get 1000 € after six months.
    

  



## 4. Flexibility & Remote Work


  

We offer a flexible work environment and flexible hours, and as long as you do what you have to do, meet your objectives and coordinate accordingly with your team, we are not so worried if you work at the office, in a coffee shop, on your sofa at home, or the beach!

  

-   **Flexible** schedules and **Part Time** working arrangements.
    
-   **Remote work** if you are based in either **Spain, Portugal or UK**
    
-   We will provide you with everything you need to do great work, such as **laptop, tools and work from home equipment.**
-   **2 annual **gatherings paid**** by the company.
    

  

## 5. Care.



  

At Vizzuality, we have come a long way to implement initiatives to empower both mothers and fathers to be competent at home and skilled workers, whilst enabling women and men to have a balanced and meaningful life inside and outside home.

  

### 5a. Caregiving Support

  

At some point in our lives we will all have someone to care for and/or who is dependent on us. It might be a new born baby, a child at school, or maybe one of our elders or family members who needs support from us.

  

To reduce barriers to care and caregiving, **everyone at Vizzuality with the responsibility of supporting a dependent person, will receive extra days for caregiving.** 

Depending on the dependent person you are caring for, you will be entitled to the following:

  

-   **0 - 3 years old, and/or dependents with disabilities (ie. family members, elders)** = 3 extra days a year
    
-   **3 - 6 years old** = 2 extra days a year
    
-   **6 - 18 years old** = 1 extra day a year
    

  

***What’s the process to get this benefit?** You will have to request it in Bamboo as with other types of leave.*

  

***What is a dependent person?** A dependent person relies on someone else to provide the basic necessities of life, autonomy and/or for support (ie. financial, emotional, mental, physical, extreme advanced age) and can include new born babies, children, elders or other relatives.*

  

***What is a basic necessity of life?** Those most elementary tasks that allow a person to live a life with a minimum of autonomy and independence, such as: personal care, basic house chores/tasks, essential mobility, recognise people and objects, orient themselves, understand and execute orders and/or simple tasks.*

  

***I am not sure if this applies to me?** Let's talk. If you have any questions in regards to how this benefit could be applicable for your specific case and/or how it could be integrated with other initiatives we currently have at Vizz (ie. unpaid leave), please feel free to reach out.*

  

***Is this benefit “per employee” or “per dependent”?** The benefit is per employee, per year and it's not cumulative. In other words, if you have 2 kids (ie. 2 and 4 years old), you will get an annual allocation of 3 days (and not 5 days = 3 + 2).*

  

### 5b. Private Health Insurance

  

*(For now this benefit is only applicable to people in Spain)*

  

Mapfre is a leading insurance company providing us with health and dental coverage, and has a wide coverage in all the country. You can check the details of the insurance policy and coverage in the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HjLm1HCAK8M1nYknYungnc8-Ih71pa5I/view?usp=sharing).

  

The way this will work is:

-   **Vizzuality will pay for a part or all of the coverage** depending on the time you’ve been hired.
    
-   Employee pays for the rest via a **deduction in your payslip** pre-taxes (IRPF exempt)
    
-   Employee **can opt in at any time**, and as time passes they will be eligible for **lower contributions**.
    
-   Employee can **add family members** (Spouse and children) at a fixed cost per person also pre-taxes.
    

  
Below you can see the **cost for you** depending on the years you’ve been hired at Vizzuality:


-   **1st Year:** 50:50 split cost
    
-   **2nd Year:** You pay 25% and Vizz 75%
    
-   **3rd Year:** Vizz covers 100% of the cost and it becomes free for you.
    

  


### 5c. Mental Health Support


  

Mental health support via **Spill**, our third-party provider, to connect you with **qualified counselors and curated resources**. ([More information](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/vizz-well-being-you-ll-soon-be-able-to-access-a-new-benefit-use-it-while-it-lasts-113720)).

#**Claiming Expenses**

The expenses covered by Vizzuality depend on the type of travel and destination. So, we  have the following situations:

## Between offices - Madrid / Cambridge / Porto

Type of expenses paid by Vizzuality:
- Accommodation 
- Transportation ( Flights, trains, taxi…)

We don’t include expenses for meals because we have a kitchen in all three offices (fridge and microwave) so we consider that it’s not necessary.

## Other Places (USA for example)
Type of expenses paid by Vizzuality:

- Accommodation 
- Transportation ( Flights, trains, taxis)
- Expenses related with meals. We will pay the expenses you can justify with tickets/invoices up to 50$/day. It’s important to save all tickets , we won’t pay expenses without the corresponding ticket.

## Justification

It’s important to save all tickets , we won’t pay expenses without the corresponding ticket. 

After your trip, you should send all your tickets/invoices to Liuba and fill in the template attached here below. She will transfer the total amount at the end of the month with your payrolls.

# What is the metaphor/ concept behind this site?

## Useful for. 
Working out Information Architecture and key principles to consider when thinking about how different features relate to each other. 

## How to do it. 
Give everyone a few postits/ pieces of paper and ask them to think about a concept or metaphor that describes the website for them. For example, is it a tree: something with lots of hidden roots, a single main visible part and lots of branches. Or is it a Laboratory; a place to experiment, create new knowledge? Give everyone 5 minutes or so to think of ideas, then ask them to present one by one. After all the ideas we have a round of questions and voting to see the concepts which best capture what we’re aiming for.

**A good example.** [Mozilla](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBSjdhQ25TWEZxaFU) and [PSA](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vWFCMzil_6NndzPfF989y2ZgZ68gNBeu).
 
**Time needed.** 35 minutes. 2 minutes to set up, 5 minutes thinking, 18 minutes presenting and thinking, 10 minutes voting

# What content should be on this site?

## Useful for.
Getting consensus from client and with the team about the key things that need to be on the site, and which are less priority/ stretch goals. 

## How to do it. 
Nominate one scribe. Get a big whiteboard, wall or flipchart. Ask people to ‘tell me contents that need to be on the site’. Note we’re looking for pieces of content (datasets, information, types of visualisation etc) rather than pages (needs a home page, needs a map page) - we could combine these different pieces of information in multiple ways later. So the idea here is just to understand everything we could possibly put on it. 

After some time and the ideas start to dry up, run a voting exercise. First, let the client Star any item that is absolutely mandatory (legal, donor requirement etc). Then everyone gets about 5 stars to add to different things; note we are looking for “most interesting or useful for the key personas” not “the thing you’re most interested in”. 

**A good example.** PSA [notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DAoxLXuO4gzlpCEMmvY0e6fN3iF0sVZS) and LHI [pics in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Lxx39Ka8yhlZiPBBDDHrbZ5WpZmNg-RC)

**Time needed.** 20 minutes (2 mins setup, 10 mins creating it, 8 mins refining)

# Core Principles of Feedback at Vizz

## Why give feedback?

Feedback helps us improve in some aspects of our work. This can manifest for us as:

- Becoming more self-aware of strengths & weaknesses
- Improving technical skills
- Surfacing more opportunities for knowledge sharing
- Building effective connections between workmates
- Increasing efficiency
- Developing openness

Ultimately we would like there to be a culture in the company, where people feel comfortable giving impartial feedback and can effectively act upon advice when given.

***

## Goals

General Criteria to be met:

- Creation of feedback guidelines with everybody participating!
- Focus on rich and frequent feedback
- Must be applicable/useful to the contexts from earlier
- More horizontal, less top-down.
- More open
- To be implemented using Champions/Ambassadors

# Review, Evaluation and Coaching guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and best practices to establish a common conceptual framework and processes for effective goal setting and evaluation across the company.

This is work in progress and subject to change after discussions with the team.

## Setting goals and expectations

First of all make sure you are familiar with the goals and objectives for the team as a whole [link to doc with [core competencies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ng6H8mzKMt98nUkeJofLgemHIoW2o2xPqZKaKq1Tz1Q/edit), purpose/vision of the company, etc] and the key responsibilities and competencies of the person you’re going to supervise [link to job family, job-specific competencies and KRAs]. 

Talk to the exec team and to whoever is currently (or has in the past been) setting objectives, managing or overseeing that person.

Hold a "performance planning" session at the beginning of the term, to discuss that person’s goals and your expectations as well as explaining this process and making sure KRAs, competencies, goals, and the evaluation processes are understood. 

Make sure you set the baseline for current and desired competencies and results. Define what success should look like. Set down Key Responsibility Areas and Key Performance Indicators if they don’t yet exist for that person. Check out that role’s set of competencies and how it matches against them.

* KRAs are just verb+name (*write data rendering javascript code*) with no implicit valuation.

* KPIs are about measuring KRAs in terms of quality, quantity, cost or timeliness and may be expressed as quantitative or descriptive (like: *reduce to half the number of bugs in production code*).

* Competencies describe the knowledge, skills, behaviors, attributes, abilities, and attitudes that are essential to achieving the results expected. A competency is a significant talent, skill, or proficiency that helps an individual generate superior performance.

Define goals and expectations as a combination of behavior and results:

-performance → result oriented → KPI (or OKR?) related

-development → behavior-oriented → competence related

Setting specific and difficult goals is better than just urging people to do their best. Clear deadlines for goal completion are better than loose ones. If you can’t set a tight deadline perhaps the goal needs to be broken down.

Goals should be set along with expected measurable outcomes and preferably a date. They shouldn’t focus on the means (eg *attend a course or give a talk*) but on the outcome (eg *get a skill or ability, perform to a certain measure*)

Keep it simple, no more than 3-4 goals per term plus the normal expectations of the position are more than enough.

It’s important that goals are shared and assumed, and your team should be comfortable with publicly (or at least privately to you if they are personal) committing to them. 

When setting goals it is useful to ask ourselves 4 questions:

* What do we want and don’t have (achieve)

* What do we have and want (preserve)

* What we don’t have and don’t want (avoid)

* What do we have and don’t want (eliminate)

Some initial sources of effective goals:

* Things that help get a better quality

* Things that help get a higher impact 

* Things that help the team as a whole to work better and achieve the   points

* Things that open new business opportunities or create new core competencies in the organization.

* Things that help the person develop or enhance their competencies

* Things that help reduce cost, time and effort

## One-on-Ones and coaching

During the term you should regularly have one-on-ones and coaching sessions with your team. These can be informal but are different from the casual coffee machine chat. You should plan for them, make them actionable and document the outcomes - they will come handy later on.

### One on One

These are informal but scheduled conversations to talk about whatever comes up. Always listen first, and if nothing comes up, you can chat about things like:

**Daily work**: Anything bothering you? Roadblocks? Things that are working better?

**Team collaboration and relations**: who’s rocking it in your team? Who helps you out? How? How can we improve teamwork?

**Happiness**: Are you happy working here? Are you happy with your recent work? Why or why not?

**Short-term goals**: How are projects going? What can we do to help? What are the main bottlenecks? Can we do anything to move it along? What are the projects you would be interested in working on next?

**Long-term goals**: How do you think about your progress on your goals? What needs to be done to move towards the goals? What can we do to help?

**Personal development**: Do you feel like you are learning at work? What are the new things you learned lately? What are the areas you want to learn about?

Whom in the team do you want to learn from? 

**Feedback**: What can we do to make your work easier? How can we support you better?

What is something we could have done better? 

### Coaching

In many cases, you will feel that the person could benefit from your experience to achieve goals and get competencies. In these cases, coaching is an effective support tool where you can put your experience in context to help them develop. Remember, coaching is not training, and before someone can benefit from it they should be properly trained for the job. 

Coaching someone involves the following functions:

**Giving advice** to help them improve their performance. Giving advice doesn’t mean telling the person how to do the job, but offering suggestions based on your experience. For effective advice it is imperative that you **listen** to the person’s concerns and opinions

Providing **guidance** so that they can develop their skills and knowledge appropriately. 

Providing **support** (but being there only when your presence is needed). It involves being available when they need help, but not monitoring and controlling the person’s every move. The responsibility for improving is theirs. 

Giving **confidence** as a positive feedback that allows people to feel confident about what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, as well as letting them know about areas where they need to improve. 

Helping them gain greater **competence** by guiding them toward acquiring more knowledge and sharpening their skills so that they are better prepared for more complex tasks and higher-level roles.

## Writing the review

Some time before the face-to-face review, go over other notes you’ve kept during the term from the planning meeting, the one-on-ones and your own observations (like a well-executed project, a deadline missed or handling a difficult client). Also, ask them to jot down a few things they’ve done over the last year that they’re proud of, and their general feelings about how they did. Ask for feedback from others in the company who work closely with them. The larger the number of independent evaluations the better.

Record your observations and judgments about their performance as objectively as possible, and tie your conclusions to hard data including speciﬁc examples:

* Details about what you observed.

* Supporting data, such as indicators, reports or team feedback

* The impact on the team and organization

* The degree of accomplishment of their goals

Expressing your observations as neutral facts rather than judgments is particularly important when giving negative feedback. When giving positive feedback, on the other hand, it’s ok to combine speciﬁc achievements with character-based praise.

[TBD] Use your judgment to rank the person in a scale from 1 to 5, where 3 means that person actually did all that was expected from them (met goals and expectations) [link to rank explanation goes here]

Note: we need to do some work here to figure out if we want a ranking system, how complex it should be and how we’d use it.

Hold a calibration session with your peer reviewers and the executive team. We need to make sure we normalize reviews before handing them out.

## Communicating the review

A couple of hours before the meeting you should have shared a copy of your review with them, so they can prepare and your conversation can be focused on the outstanding items. The majority of the conversation should go about things the person has done well, however, do not sugarcoat bad news.

After discussing the strengths and achievements (and also the issues), ask how they feel about how things are going and listen carefully to their response, taking notes if necessary.

Then give feedback (a "stop, start, and continue" model often works well):

What are they doing now that is not working? (what should stop)

What are they doing that is highly effective? (what should continue)

What actions should they take to be more so? (what should start)

Focus on behaviors, not dispositions. Give specific advice and targeted praise. Don’t say: ‘You need to be more proactive.’ but something like: ‘You need to take more initiative in solving bug reports and informing the team.'

# Describing this project

## Useful for. 
Understanding the objectives of the site, the tone of the site, messaging. 

## How to do it. 
Give everyone a stack of post-its and a pen. Ask them to think of adjectives they would use to describe the project. Is it fun, serious, rigorous, influential, disruptive? When everyone’s had about 5 minutes, get them to read them out one-by-one, and start grouping them around themes as they arise. We use postits so that the groups can keep shifting and changing as each additional person comes. 

**A good example.** Public Safety Assessment. [See the pictures we took](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oKo5xDYwPjkaCJC3QLcH8khOY_d52rvq) and the [write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnfFvdkdGdEdN1tvgJlHCHJ7KaKMjTYi_LjCt4U0wKI/edit#heading=h.e9z7fk7dz3m4). 

**Time needed.** 25 minutes (2 mins setup, 5 mins thinking, 18 mins presenting and grouping)

# Design system.
Creating a design system not only helps your team produce more consistent user experiences, it also builds bridges between design and development. By creating a common visual language codified through design tokens, and a set of components and patterns cataloged in a UI library, you’ll vastly improve designer/developer communication. You’ll also have fine-tuned control of the UI in a way that is manageable, scalable, and robust.
Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:
- **It’s consistent.** The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s self-contained.** Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **It’s reusable.** You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
- **It’s accessible.** Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust.** No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.

## Introduction
The first thing you should do is to ask yourself some questions that need to be clear before you start designing:
- What’s the goal of this tool (you’re about to build)?
- What do you know about the brand?
- What’s the scope of the project? The aim of this question is to find the best approach to face a project. Is it a prototype? Are we going to deliver a tool we’re not going to be taking care of? Is this an ongoing project? (how much) Do we have to innovate? What do they expect from us? What value do we need to add ... 
- Which questions does it have to answer?
- Which are its’ users?

## Design Principles
Here some Design Principles we (as Vizzuality) should always meet that we also should bespoke for every project we do: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17fxCrPVurVXRNkpZHsM9oVdGebj8so-uFR0n73GZETw/edit 

## Understand Users
Be sure that the site/designs we created meet their needs. Without users, your design wouldn’t exist. 
Acceptance tests doc: https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/stories-and-acceptance-tests/

# Wireframe template.
Wireframe base sketch:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/nm1f3ykle33utcd/Wireframe_base.sketch?dl=0
## How to use it?
This is an internal tool to help designers build in a more efficient way different wireframes
1. Copy the sketch file
2. Rename it following the file naming guideline in “Folder and file architecture”
3. Design in the ‘Wireframe’ page helped by the created symbols and templates (for further information about how to use symbols, consult [Symbols in the Sketch documentation](https://sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/))

## How to present it
To give context or further explanations to the wireframe when sharing it, here you are some PDF as a reference and templates to build the presentation: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t3fulazhja31new/AABuqP23lJvc8JxF4DdeBI8_a?dl=0


# UI Kit Template.
There is a UI Kit template we’ve created and that should be used for the rest of designers during the design process. The sooner there’s a visual design line defined (in a difference with the exploration phase) the better. Using this UI Kit soon will save time and avoid future inconsistencies.  

**Resource Watch UI Kit library sketch:**
https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9xno3h9gbft8sr/RW_UIKit.sketch?dl=0
(for further information about how to use libraries, consult [Libraries in the Sketch documentation](https://sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/))

**Prototype Demo:**
https://invis.io/TVPDD7BZYKS#/240485596_UI_Kit
(for further information about how to send your designs into InVision, consult ['Introduction to Craft Sync'](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210310026-Introduction-to-the-Craft-Sync-plugin))

## How to use it?
- We should upload the UI Kit on InVision with the rest of the design screens, preferable to have all the groups and name of the assets under control.
- As we (and that’s something we should push internally) will work with symbols and libraries it’s easier for everyone to acknowledge if there is something new on the design, or if we've decided to change/adapt the UI.
- Make sure every asset is exportable with the needed format (svg, png..)
- Design button states (we could agree that with the dev.). 
- All the icons should be in black and we should contain them inside a standardized box size. (16px, 24px…). 
- For colors it’s not important to add the name of each one of them, what it is actually needed is the alpha colors we are working with.
- Specify the layout for each design we deliver. 
- Create a navigation through the different UI kit elements for mobile and desktop.
- Tipo. => Work with styles

## Extra notes:
- We always missed important inputs status: (Disabled, Placeholder, Focus, Validation + messages)
- Maybe not for this phase, but it would be great if we can work with grids/baseline.

# Feedback Loops at Vizzuality: Giving Effective Feedback

## *Overview*

The idea here is to lay out a set of principles that should be universally applied when giving and taking feedback, regardless of the context that feedback is being given or received, and should be used as a guideline for both participants in the process.

***

## Nurturing a Culture

The goals are:

- Everyone is comfortable and open.
- We address challenges together.
- We have clear expectations.
- There's no such thing as a stupid question.
- There are ongoing positive and/or corrective processes for everyone.
- We all make it a priority to improve each other and the whole organization. 

Every day, we should aim to improve ourselves, the company, and offer useful feedback to our peers.

***

### When to Give Feedback?

Ideally you should give somebody informal feedback to someone you are working with once each day. The first step towards doing this is recognising opportunities to give feedback:

- *During handovers*
  
  Handovers between functional groups are likely to surface opportunities for rich feedback. Bridging the gap in understanding between researchers, designers, data-scientists, and devs is core to becoming more productive and efficient so try go give feedback that can aid smooth these transitions.

- *When you see good work being done!*
  
  Positive feedback is essential to making sure we keep on doing what we're awesome at.

- *When you recognise an opportunity for improvement*
  
  More on this below.

- *At the end of a sprint*

  How could teh sprint have run more smoothly? Feedback between you and your PM could well improve productivity of future sprints.

***

## What to give Feedback about?

Try to choose talking points that are relevant to current work/projects, and ensure that your points aren’t all negative ones!

Feedback is most useful to someone when likelihood of improvement is high. So it is important to identify what areas are more appropriate to give feedback on - some are more difficult than others! Consider the following:

```
(easy)    Technical Skills
  
  Ʌ       Working Practices (e.g. Time Management)
  |
  |       Knowledge
  |
  |       Attitudes
  |
  V       Habits
   
(hard)    Personality
```

Try to focus on easier topics and successes that are likely to get the biggest positive returns in a reasonable time frame.

***

## Giving Feedback Effectively

These principles are concerned with how to give feedback effectively:

1. **Feedback needs to be shared *frequently* and in *context*.**

    This is probably the most important set of principles to work under. There are two ways that ‘in context’ can be interpreted. Both are important!

    *Time-context*:

    You should aim to discuss recent topics. Trying to improve on something that happened two weeks ago will always be more difficult than when the event is fresh in the mind and can be acted upon immediately. Giving feedback little and often achieves this.

    *Topic-context*:

    Also, always aim to ensure that your discussion sticks to the point. Don’t go off on tangents and talk about unrelated issues. Find the core of what you want to discuss, reduce it down to only a few key points, and stick to them. Be clear and direct.


2. **Aim to achieve a specific outcome, needs to be realistic in its expectations.**
   
   Discuss next steps together, ensuring that the goals outlined are achievable within a reasonable time frame. Don’t be afraid to block goals into smaller chunks or waypoints. Larger, more abstract goals (“you should improve your cooking skills”) should be matched with smaller, clearer task that help the receiver of the feedback achieve the goal (“try using a recipe from this cooking book next time”). Making progress feel real and attainable goes a long way!


3. **Expresses a point of view rather than an absolute truth.**
   
   Remember that your feedback represents a point of view, one that he recipient may not necessarily agree with. Don’t back yourself into a corner by presenting your opinions as fact, and allow the recipient to respond.
   
   Criticism and praise should ultimately be viewed as being the same so being objective about your thoughts nurtures a two way conversation which is less about ‘*good and bad*’ and more about ‘*improvement and how to get there*’.


4. **It should show respect for the recipient and is a two-way conversation.**
   
   As has been outlined in the other three points, acting on feedback can break down when viewed as an order or directive by the recipient. Always nurture the idea of feedback as a collaboration. Respect their thoughts and be prepared to shift your stance at times.


# Growth Framework

 ***Following a group consent decision making process, the framework described below passed with no objections on July 15th 2021.***

(*) [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckv4duCOS74SiRpb-mY5MayZ6LJgNkSbKTR8yWsdhIo/edit) to create your own copy of the framework and use it during your Self Reflection to write down your ideas, comments, etc.

(**) [Original Blogpost - Group Decision Making](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/growth-framework-proposal-for-consent-139629)

## Guideline Content.

 1. **Purpose**
 2. **Key elements:** Language + Hierarchy + Principles
 3. **The Framework** (Tiers, levels, expectations)
 4. FAQs:
	 - **How to use** the Framework?
	 - Does everyone have to take the **same path**? 
	 - To **“move up”** within Tiers do I have to have mastered absolutely everything in the previous tiers?
	 - What is **Seniority** at Vizzuality?
	 - What do we mean when we say **Leadership**?
	 - How does this link with **FA specific skills**?
	 - Are there any **SMO skills**?

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of having a Growth Framework  is to help the organisation and our people adapt and evolve at the same time, by having a **common language**, **clearer mutual expectations** and **better conversations** when it comes to growth and development.

(More info about this question on the [video](https://loom.com/share/7277ecbe6e7c4be0acd9a9ba1a65251e))

## 2. Key elements: Language + Hierarchy + Principles

### a. "Language... Common & Explicit"

 To be able to improve the way we talk about salary and growth, we need a common and explicit language for us all to use so **“everyone can be on the same page”** 

The Framework is aimed to provide a **system that will enable 2 (or more) people to have a shared language and improve the way we dialogue** when it comes to  growth, salary, impact, contributions, etc.  

By defining and **clarifying expectations for each seniority level** (ie. skills, behaviours, attitudes, challenges, etc.) people will be able to better understand their contributions, express their ideas and develop their thinking when it comes to assessing their performance and guiding their growth.

### b. "Hierarchy… based on Growth"

The first step for growing your career at Vizzuality is to **excel at the job you were hired to do.**

Along with the above, the aim with this proposal is to also evolve the organisation to a place in which we value and recognise not only the importance of being technically competent when doing your job, but also **other elements that will help the organisation grow and become more sustainable in the long term**, such as the ability to help and care for others, think critically, examine and develop ourselves, take accountability and initiative, amongst others.

The framework will then take a more **holistic approach** as it will recognise the **different ways we all have to add value** to our purpose and how we grow ourselves, our teams and the organisation. 

### c. "Our Principles...acting as an umbrella"

As described in our website, our principles (Delight, Trust, Care, Grow, Fun) should **guide our decisions, our ways of working and the relationships** we have with each other, our clients, and our partners. 

These very same principles are used within the Framework with the intention of providing consistency and alignment between the **“things we say to the world and what we do internally”.**

## 3. The Framework

### Delight
*We use our deep understanding of people’s needs to spark delight. (Quality, Performance, Expertise)*

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions

### How to use the Framework?

Whenever you have to do your Self Reflection, instead of just reflecting using the [guiding questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sb08poKFwuhzktCQ38WmXgi2RSstzRIn02aXWfLaxR8/edit) (shared back in January 2020), you can now use the Growth Framework to add some context, richness and depth to your reflection.

Take a look at the framework principles, tiers and expectations, and try to answer the following questions:

**Performance:**
- Where do I see myself in the matrix today?
- What do I do well?
- Where do I see my strengths within the tiers and principles?

**Growth:**

 - Where do I see myself going? 
 - What do I need to develop? 
 - Which challenges do I need to tackle next?


### Does everyone have to take the same path? Do we all have to cover all principles/levels in the matrix?

**Not at all.** Depending on your personal interests and the way you would like to add value to the organisation, **everyone will be empowered to choose how they grow and the path they wish to take**.

  

I believe there are many ways in which we can add value to our company. Encouraging and promoting just the vertical progression doesn’t feel healthy or relevant, especially in today’s complex world of work and diverse careers ahead of us all.

  

I would like Vizzuality to be less about “ladders to the top” or just one “generic career path applicable to everyone”, and more about a **“wide net of opportunities, networks and challenges”** for people to “move up, move sideways, move down” depending on personal needs and willingness to contribute to the organisation.

  

For example, some people might want to develop only within “Delight” and stay in that track because they are interested in adding value in the technical area (performance, quality, etc.). Some other people might want to take a more blended approach and develop a bit of all 3 tracks. In the same way, some people might want to grow themselves all the way to Tier 4, and for some others it will be enough to develop just a section of that “Track” and get to Tier 2 for example.

  

In summary, **not everyone must get to Tier 4, or be in all 3 tracks (principles)**. But as an organisation I believe we must have as much of the elements presented in the framework. In other words, **you don't have to be good at everything, but ideally as a whole team we must cover the framework.**

### To “move up” within Tiers do I have to have mastered absolutely everything in the previous tiers?

No. You don't have to master everything within each Tier to move along the framework.

  

**The Framework is not intended to be a “tick all the boxes” exercise**, but more a tool to facilitate dialogue and mutual understanding in regards to growth and performance. Or in other words, the framework is intended to offer you a **“general sense”** of your performance and growth, but is not asking you to “be good at everything”.

  

When mapping yourself using the framework, **it's very likely that you will find yourself positioned in several Tiers of the Framework at the same time**, which is perfectly fine and expected because performance and growth are very complex “things” to address.

  

And this is also applicable when it comes to moving along the Framework. It will be expected for people to move along the Tracks **even if they haven't “ticked all the boxes” in each Tier**.

  

In summary, and both for mapping yourself and also for moving along the Tiers, **the most important is to get a “general sense of where am I the most” rather than “ticking all the boxes”.**

# The Headline Game
Each participant is given 3 minutes to write a 160 character ‘headline’ indicating how they want people to be talking about the project when it launches. Think of a newspaper or website, or even someone you know; what’s the headline of the article about the site you’re building? What’s their reaction? 

**Time needed:** 20 minutes (2 mins set up, 3 mins thinking, 6-7 mins presenting, 8-9 mins analysis and discussion)

# A session about personas
If personas are already well known, make a lightning presentation introducing each of the key personas and their needs. Where possible try and create handouts/ printouts so everyone has the personas to hand when they are making decisions. 
If personas are not already well known by Vizzuality but the client has a lot of information, see the additional activity to create personas. 

# Next steps closing session
The final session should be a 15 minute discussion with everyone in the sprint, where we decide and assign next steps to people. Quite often our next steps are
- Design team create wireframes
- Send request for clarifications to the client
- Client send data sample to discuss
- For client kickoff meetings we may also add some logistical next steps like:
- Set up weekly meetings
- Open a basecamp and populate it with the first todos. You should also use this session to do a quick basecamp tutorial for the client, explaining how we use it, how we want to receive comments etc.

**Time needed:** 15 mins + 5 mins for a basecamp demonstration if needed

# Hiring guidelines
Bringing new people to the team is one of the most important processes for us. It helps us achieve our strategic priorities and ultimately brings us closer to our vision and purpose. Hiring is a big decision that affects resources and shapes the company we want to work at. A new hire is not just a set of capacities and skills, it is a person with whom we will spend many hours working side-by-side, who will hopefully develop personally and professionally with us and from whom we can learn.

A good (or bad) hiring decision affects us all and we believe the process should be as collective, open and transparent as possible.

This document outlines the general processes, tools and guidelines we use in a hiring process, and assumes the decision to hire someone has already been taken and the resources allocated. The process for deciding when to open a position is not covered here.

## Writing a job description
Job descriptions should be based on the evaluation of the role we are looking for, its key responsibility areas, the competencies, and the characteristics we value in all team members, such as:

- Aligned to our purpose and vision.
- Proactive and constructive. 
- Results oriented, pragmatic.
- Positive and upbeat
- Team player
- Responsive
- Honest and generous

[A WIP document with Vizzuality’s core competencies can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ng6H8mzKMt98nUkeJofLgemHIoW2o2xPqZKaKq1Tz1Q/edit) These are competencies that we expect from all team members at diferent levels, regardless of their role.

Specific roles have additional competencies, mostly technical; but they could also be about leadership or communication depending on the role. Before hiring for a role we should take time to define such competencies. 

- [An example for a front end engineer can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcZyJNBfF6VmwE9uAYZe3A23lleoEhtWKB7QIEZW2nA/edit)

- [An example for a user researcher can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sg6bL3MCyDvjSkfwCY0H5nTftiYx9_yHsXqgLW1u_Zw/edit)

A job description should generally contain:

- A clear and straightforward description of the job opening: _We are looking for a front-end engineer to join our team on a full-time contract in our office in Madrid or Porto._

- A brief description of Vizzuality that also includes our values, vision and purpose. You can use the text below for this

> Vizzuality is a world-leading data design agency based in Madrid, Cambridge, Porto and Washington, DC. Our talented team of designers, 
> engineers and scientists work together to end malaria, stop deforestation and tackle climate change. We do this by designing and 
> developing data-driven tools and applications for international organizations who focus on conservation, development, open data, and 
> transparency. With our help, they’re able to share their stories with people more effectively and compel behavior changes that lead to a 
> better world for everybody.

> We’re looking for someone who is passionate about using their creativity and skills to create momentum that leads to social change. In 
> return, we offer opportunities to work on interesting and innovative projects. We also offer a competitive salary, flexible working hours, 
> and many opportunities to learn and grow with a supportive and diverse team of specialists.

- An explanation of our general motivation and expectations around our new peer.

- A descriptive text about the role, its importance for us, our projects and our purpose as a company.

- A list of key responsibility areas and daily tasks (_Advanced JavaScript programming of innovative interfaces and large client-side applications. Configuration and optimization of client-side libraries and frameworks…_), and also additional sporadic or possible responsibilities (_Assisting in proposals, Representing us in talks and conferences…_)

- A list of expected skills and competencies, including the desired level of each (Proficiency, experience, knowledge, familiarity…). These should be also stated as must or nice to have if that’s the case.

- Any mandatory or disqualifying criteria like english level, visa status, academic level (if they exist.

- [TBD] A note about diversity and equal opportunity

- Clear instructions on how to apply, and mandatory info (CV, cover letter, code samples, document formats, etc)

When writing a job description we should always check our text for gender or racial bias, and avoid clichés such as “superstar”, “champion” or “hero”. The whole text should permeate our values, purpose and core competencies. Be 'cooperative' not 'competitive' 

We sometimes use automatic tools to check the text for gender bias (link to tool here), but in general it’s always good to have a few people read it to refine and spot possible issues.

## Posting the job ad

Once the description has been written and reviewed we use BambooHR to publish it and manage the selection process. When creating a selection process there’s a few options to fill in, such as title, description, contract type or location. Please provide a BambooHR admin with this info to post the ad.

There’s also the possibility to add required or optional application questions such as CV, cover letter, link to personal website, LinkedIn or GitHub account, available date, etc Custom questions can also be added.

After creating the advert, the opening will be announced internally to all company (a good place to do this is in the #general channel). During this announcement, it's recommended to remind employees about their referal bonus and ask to share it as broadly as possible. It's important to ask for volunteers to work as collaborators during the incoming hiring process.
 
People who volunteer will be added as collaborators to the BambooHR application feed.
Collaborators will have access to all the application data (except for private fields such as desired salary) and ability to score, comment or contact applicants.

## Promoting the ad

Open positions are published at https://vizzuality.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/ and automatically posted to certain free listings such as glassdoor and indeed.

When a new position is published you should also talk to our comms team / lead writer about promoting it in our social networks, and post in #general so other team members can do it in theirs.

Depending on the urgency or availability we sometimes use paid services like LinkedIn recruiter. These have a cost per impressions and should be monitored if set up. Speak to DG if you think the process needs it.

Additionally there are other resources that can be used:

## Selection process
Once the post is live, collaborators will receive email updates about new candidates, comments or status changes.

### Coordinator
A coordinator will be selected (usually this role is occupied by the creator of the advert). The coordinator role will have the responsibility of assigning new candidates to each of the process' collaborators. This can be done in a first come, first served basis.

### Collaborator
When collaborators are assigned to a new candidate, they have the objective of getting the candidates through the hiring pipeline as soon as possible: either hiring the candidates or rejecting them.

If any member of the company wants to join as a collaborator once the process has started, they can do so by reaching out to anyone involved in the process. After which they will be added as a collaborator.

The collaborators don't have the responsability to perform any of the steps in the hiring pipeline by themselves. Their main responsability is to find people in the company that can participate in the necessary steps.

### Steps
> While it's very important to have empathy for the candidates throughout the process; we mustn't forget that moving a candidate forward is time consuming and has a cost, both for the company, and the candidate. Therefore it's vital to reject candidates as early in the process as possible if they are not a fit.

#### New application
When people submit a new application we should send an acknowledgement email to confirm that we correctly received their information and that their process has started.

If the hiring process is paused (i.e. during holidays), the acknowledgement email should be updated to reflect that, and provide an estimated date for resuming it.

#### First filter
A first screening can be done at this point where any of the participants can suggest to discard a candidate as “not a fit”, “not qualified” or “over qualified”. The decision to discard a candidate should be made by consent, meaning if there’s no principled objections the candidate can be discarded.

#### Review
Candidates who pass the first filter can either be marked as “reviewed” or “put on hold”. The choice is basically about priority. A candidate shouldn't be placed on hold for more that a reasonable amount of time (2 - 3 weeks), once that time has passed the candidate should be contacted to advance in the process or be notified about rejection.

If the candidate looks promising but there’s more info needed (code samples, certifications, visa status, motivations, etc): collaborators can send an email through the system requesting it (there are available templates on BambooHR for this) and change the status to “Requested more info". If a candidate doesn't reply to the request for more info after a reasonable amount of time (2 weeks), the candidate should be dismissed.

Once a satisfactory response has been received applicant can be discarded, moved to “reviewed”, or “put on hold”.

#### Phone screen
Once a candidate is set as “reviewed”, the responsible collaborator has the responsibility of finding the appropriate people inside the company to participate in the call; collaborators should also email the candidate, and change status to “Scheduled Phone Screen”.

The phone screening is a short introductory call where we try to solve doubts and get a better sense of the candidate and how they fit with the role.

Ideally phone screening should be performed by two people, one of which should be in a functional role that is similar to the open position. There should be a brief preparation beforehand where the participants identify the things they want to find out and share with the participant.

It's very important to remember that a phone screening isn't an interview. Therefore it should go to the point, covering only things partipants want to learn about, or share with the candidate.

[TBD] Ideally ~at least a part of~ the phone screening should be conducted in English.

We have a template (WIP) with possible questions for these calls. In general they should be open and focus on the competencies, skills and cultural fit of the candidate.

Apart from other specific issues (such as availability, english language, etc) we should focus on the candidate’s motivation and offer to solve any doubts they may have about the position or the company.

Outcomes of the call should be documented in the “comments” section on BambooHR candidate's page. Candidate will then be moved to "Phone screened" or discarded and informed accordingly.

#### Challenge
Sometimes we may request a skill challenge to the candidates. Challenges are normally requested to candidates whose provided portafolio isn't enough to determine their skills. Specific roles may have pre-created Challenges (e.g. [Front end coding chalenge](https://github.com/Vizzuality/coding-challenge-examples) ---> [TBD] create challenges for other roles?)

The assigned collaborator should explain clearly what we expect from the challenge, how much effort we think the candidate should put on it, the general rules and what we will be trying to learn from it. The challenge will have a reasonable time limit (1 week), that depending on the motive can be extended if necessary.

Once the challenge solution is received, the assigned collaborator should find participants to do a round of discussion around it, evaluate it and ask for clarifications if needed.

Candidates can then be discarded, put on hold or be moved to the next step in the process by consent. In all cases candidates should be contacted and informed.

#### Interview
Sucessful candidates are set for an interview. Interviews, when possible, should be conducted in person. If it’s hard to make it in person then we should make sure we have a proper set-up with cameras, a quiet environment and a good microphone. We should also set aside enough time for preparing and conducting the interview.

##### Interview participants

Ideally there should be between two and three people performing the interview. The interviewers should include someone in a similar role with equal or higher seniority. It's preferable to have as much diversity among the interviewers (role, gender, seniority) as possible.

##### Preparing the interview

In the preparation we will try to converge on the most important topics to talk about and the things we want to learn/clarify. By this stage, we should have more or less a sense of the candidates experience; the main focus should be on clarifying and cementing what we know. If we feel that there's areas where we haven't deepen enough these should be added to the interview agenda. **A key thing to keep in mind at this stage is cultural fit: we want people that want to stay at Vizzuality because they like who we are and what we do.**

Once the participants have converged on what they want to take out of the interview, they should write it down in a small list of things to ask/evaluate. (This script can be inspired in the existing template, but should be adapted to what we need to learn and who are we interviewing. The existing template is quite thorough, we probably don't need to cover all of it, and should be used as a guideline only).

##### During the interview

[TBD] Ideally ~at least a part of~ the interview should be conducted in English

A rough outline of the interview could go like this:

- Present everyone in the room, who you are, what you do, etc
- Tell the candidate about our general impresion and why we think they are a fit (so far). Share our ideas around their level (junior, mid, senior...).
- Tell them about what we want to get out from this interview, and explain the process.
- Tell the candidate we will be taking notes that may be shared with others in the team, and ask if that’s ok.
- Listen to the candidate's motivation to join us, expectations, reasons to change, background, etc. 
- Ask if they want any clarifications about the role or the company.
- Converge on expectations. Explain what we expect from the role, discuss our level evaluation and explain salary tiers.
- Ask them if they have any questions about our company and our work.
- Explain benefits.
- Ask open questions about different topics, follow the prepared script.
- Ask them again if they have any questions about our company and our work.
- Explain next steps and wrap up.

##### After the interview
After the interview the participants should have a quick debrief session, sharing their individual scores for the candidate. Each participant should grade the candidate based on the fit with what they previously set to find out and listed in the script.

The assigned collaborator should reach out to the participants and gather their notes. Posting the notes to the comments section. Finally setting the candidate as “Interviewed” or discarding using consent; in which case candidate should be informed.

#### Final decision
When there’s one or more sucessful interviewed candidates we have a number of options, all decisions to be made by consent:

- Choose one of them and make an offer.
- Request another interview to untie or clarify (ideally including people who weren’t in the first).
- Wait for more suitable candidates before making a decision. (Sticking to the reasonable time limit of "put on hold" status)

In principle there’s not a limit to the number of interviews, but we should also be conscious of the candidate’s time and availability. 

Whatever the case the candidate should be contacted and informed

If there’s a consent to hire a candidate we should send a formal offer. This is legally binding, so it should be signed by someone in the exec team.

If the candidate accepts the offer, a pre-contract is signed and all the remaining candidates are informed.

If there’s a negotiation or the offer is rejected: the selection process continues normally.

#**Accounts to setup in your first week**

As soon as possible, you should create accounts for these applications:

Google App - this will take care of email, calendar and everything else
Pivotal Tracker - for task allocation within projects (talk to your team)
Slack - for internal communication. Don't forget to download the desktop app!
Teamweek - work planning across the company (ask your buddy to invite you)
Github - code repos. Make sure you are added to the vizzuality team.
Basecamp - client comms + project-wide discussions (talk to your team about the camps you should be on)
Lastpass for teams  - we use this to store and share passwords securely (talk to David G).
Set public keys for all servers. Please talk to your PM for this (developers only)

**Don't forget to set up two-factor authentication!**
2-step verification adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code sent to your phone). I recommend using googles Authenticator app rather than SMS. If you have any doubts about this please talk with David G.
turn on 2 factor authentication in your vizzuality.com and simbiotica.es accounts (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?vid=1-635810371168859861-1666623466&rd=1)
turn on 2 factor authentication in github (you can use the same google app for codes)

# How to allocate and manage cloud resources

This guideline covers the steps you should take should you need a cloud resource, like a server to host a project, a file bucket, a Carto/(something else) account, etc.

## Project resources

Most of our projects require some sort of hosting to run on, be it a server to run code on, some hosting-as-a-service like Heroku, and S3 bucket to store files etc. More complex projects may need certain services, like Carto, Google Earth Engine, Transifex, etc.


### Resources owned by the client

While there are multiple ways in which these resources can be provisioned, the recommended way is to talk with the client and have them own these resources themselves. This carries a series of advantages both to us and the client:

- If they own their resources, there's no transfer cost or delay for either us or them, should they decide to hire another provider in the future.
- They own the service accounts, much like they own the code/design/etc we build for them.
- Should they already have a cloud infrastructure, they can consolidate to cut costs.
- For the duration of the project, we are available to have technical ownership of these resources, so we'll still set up resources as needed, even though they are not owned by us.
- Billing is handled directly between the client and the service provider, without us being needlessly in-between the two. 


We should be clear and transparent when communicating the need for these resources with the client, as these costs can appear as unexpected to some clients, and their internal budget for the project may be restricted:
- We should discuss with the client why this resource is needed.
- We should, when possible, present alternative solutions to the problem, and provide a recommendation based on our expertise, as to why a given solution is superior to the others.
- We should provide an estimated cost of the service, clarifying that it will be charged by a 3rd party, over which we have no control.
- We should be upfront about the cost of these resources.
- We should clarify if the cost is temporary (ie: staging servers) or "permanent" (ie: production servers).


Given that setting up these resources can be a quite technical process, we can help the client with the practical steps, by:
- Creating the necessary service accounts for the client, using their data.
- Setting up the resources for them.
- Providing links or other resources that helps them carry out the process themselves, should they wish to.
- Joining them on a call, screenshare, and guide them step by step if they prefer to do these steps themselves.
- Provide links or other resources covering any post-delivery maintenance tasks they may need to carry out (or advise them to hire external help, should you think that's the best option for them).

During this, we should use and recommend to clients our [security best practices](https://github.com/Vizzuality/playbook/blob/master/guidelines/security.md) when it comes to picking passwords, sharing and storing them, etc. 

Once the development phase of the project is over, don't forget to backup and delete any staging resources that may have costs associated, so we keep our client's bills as low as possible.

#### How to handle credentials for client owned accounts

Once resources are provisioned, you should save any and all credentials to Lastpass, and share them with the team members that may need access to them. Do not keep these on your Lastpass account only, as this exposes the team to [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Additionally, some credentials are only available when created, so if you don't save them straight away, you may need to regenerate them, which means updating servers, etc.

Once the project is over, and if we are not anticipating any further work, we should recommend that the client resets passwords, so they have exclusive access to their accounts.


### When "we" are the client

For some projects, we are our own client (for example, grant-based projects), so the above doesn't apply. For those situations, Vizzuality has its own set of accounts on Google, AWS, etc, that we can use to host and support our own projects, keeping in mind the following:
- First of all, you need to check with the PM if it's ok to allocate these resources to the project. The PM should check what the contract says about this type os costs, and decide how to proceed. 
- Our accounts can have resources allocated to multiple projects, so be sure to name and/or tag the resource in a way that makes it easy to match it to its corresponding project.
- For the same reason, clearly identify if a resource is a staging resource, and can be deleted once the development phase is over.
- On the project documentation, clearly identify these dependencies on external services, should we need to make adjustments in the future (ie: renew api keys, migrate accounts, account spring cleaning, etc). 
- Talk with the PM so the cost of these resources can be accounted for.


#### How to handle credentials for our accounts

Once resources are provisioned, you should save any and all credentials to Lastpass. Given that Vizzuality accounts will be needed for longer than the duration of a single project, you should check if the particular platform you are using supports having different user accounts per person. If it does, take your time to set up your own account, instead of using someone else's. Be sure to follow the [security best practices](https://github.com/Vizzuality/playbook/blob/master/guidelines/security.md) when it comes to things like password strength, storage and 2 factor authentication.

If you are creating a new account on a new service, or if the service does not allow or have more than one set of access credentials, be sure to store the credentials on Lastpass, so we are less exposed to [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Additionally, some credentials are only available when created, so if you don't save them straight away, you may need to regenerate them, which means updating servers, etc.

When setting up a new login for a colleague, you may need to define roles and permissions. When doing so, talk with them about which tasks they will be carrying out, and grant them the minimum needed permissions to carry out those tasks. Hacks happen, so the less permissions an account has, the less damage is done in case its compromised. 

#**How to Run a big event like Datamovida.**

#datamovida in a nutshell.
Datamovida is a living, breathing data movement. Four amazing speakers share their inspiring data stories with 30 specially chosen experts at four unique locations that represent our ethos. Led by members of vizzuality’s team, the group is guided to each venue and introduced to the places and events that have shaped the city. Local drinks and food are dished up at each stop and time is made for conversations. 

#Why did we do it?

The first datamovida was held on the eve of the International Open Data Conference 2016. Open data experts were travelling to our hometown from all over the world and we wanted to put our name on the map. We decided to break free of the conference room and organise an event no-one would ever forget. That event turned out to be datamovia. 

#Process for agreeing to do it
1 - Make a proposal. What do we want to achieve by running this, what will the Return on Investment be? 
2 - Check budgets; can we afford to do it?
3 - Get consent - you're going to need a lot of help from people across the company to make it happen, so getting their buy-in and consent early on will be important to make it a success.

#Six tips for organising an event like this 

For more information and tips from Camellia, [read this retrospective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RF0qmWpKVyN5H6cOq0DCKUBIl6EjqbjWmOrF9cnRXOw/edit#)

##Tip 1. Get organised. 
When we planned the first ever datamovida we used basecamp to create to-do lists and assign responsibilities. However, because a project lead wasn’t assigned straight away, the basecamp was a jumble of many ideas added in by different people. There were duplications and it was unclear when everything was supposed to be done by or what tasks were co-dependent on each other. 

One evening, I turned off all my notifications and worked out a proper plan with realistic timescales and deadlines. I worked back from the day of the event itself and figured out when everything had to be done. Once this was done, I re-ordered the to-do list into a week-by-week checklist of tasks so I could look at basecamp each morning and see what had to be done that week. This meant that nothing would get forgotten or neglected because it was buried. 

One thing I would have done differently was order the stickers earlier. They were the wrong colour but there wasn’t time to get them re-printed. 

In short:

- Create a plan by starting at the day of the event and working back to schedule in everything that needs to be done to make the event happen.
- Create a to-do list in Basecamp and order the deliverables by the week in which they must be done. This means nothing will be duplicated and you can factor in things like supply times. 

##Tip 2. Surround yourself with knowledgeable people.
I don’t speak Spanish or live in Spain so datamovida would not have happened without Liuba and Laura booking the venues, ordering the equipment, paying the bills, and asking practical questions about the logistics of the event. We also wouldn’t have had the amazing speakers we had if it weren’t for Craig’s contacts and persuasive personality. And finally, the route we took would have taken forever to figure out if it wasn’t for the local knowledge of the Madrid team. 

If I had done one thing differently, it would have been to get some advice from someone with experience of organising large, complicated events. 

In short:

Choose people to help you who have experience, knowledge, and contacts that you don’t currently have. 

##Tip 3. Delegate.
This tip is an extension of the second one. One person alone cannot organise and coordinate an event that involves herding a large group of people through a busy city. Delegating specific tasks and roles to different people will help reduce the burden you put on yourself. By sharing the responsibility, you open up the possibility of finding a better idea or solution than the one you thought of yourself. Other people might point out something you hadn’t thought of yourself and reassure you when you freak out that no-one is going to turn up. 

Organising datamovida was something we had to do on top of our regular, everyday job, so delegating was especially important for our team. Working together meant we could share the workload and take a personal interest in making sure it was a success. 

In short:

- Don’t shred your nerves and have a break down. Share the burden with others by delegating tasks and responsibilities.
- Do this by giving people clear instructions of what is expected of them and set realistic objectives. 

##Tip 4. Scout out potential locations on foot.
When we started planning datamovida we originally thought we would start at the vizzuality office and make our way down to Media-lab Prado. But when we looked at google maps, we realised it was a very long walk and adjusted the route to start at the more central CARTO offices instead. 

Once we knew which neighbourhoods we’d be walking through, I shared a request for venue ideas in the Madrid slack channel. Some great places were suggested and a small group of us went to check them out. Going out on foot was helpful because it gave us an idea of how long it would take to walk between each venue and see which streets would be too narrow or busy to take a large group of people along. In the end, we walked the route three times before the main event. 

In short:
- Sketch out a rough idea for a route and check the walking times on google maps.
- Ask the locals for their venue suggestions. 
- Spend an evening scouting venues and getting a feel for the area.
- While you are at each potential venue, talk to someone to find out if it’s possible to hire the venue for an hour on the night you will hold your datamovida. 
- Once the route is finalised, walk it again to make sure all the streets are interesting and suitable for taking a large group along them.
- Remember that large groups walk very slowly so don’t try to make them walk too far in one go. - Pick venues that are no more than 15-20 minutes apart. 

##Tip 5. Double check all your bookings (and be flexible when things go awry). 

Two days before the Madrid datamovida took place, we got an email from Martinez Bar saying they had to cancel our booking because they had double booked the space we wanted. There was no way we’d have been able to find another place at such short notice so Laura got straight on the phone to sort it out. We’d originally booked the venue because it had an interesting little cellar area that was perfect for a group of our size. But sadly, the space had been given to another group and for whatever reason, they took priority over us. However, Laura was able to negotiate exclusive access to another area inside the venue and it was still a cool place. 

The night before datamovida, a couple of us made a final run-through of the route to make sure there weren’t any road closures or problems that had appeared since our last scouting trip. At the venue that had almost cancelled our booking I asked about the food we’d ordered. The blank look I got in return told me that the food hadn’t been ordered. Apparently the guy hadn’t seen our email with our order. The moral here is that confirming in writing isn’t always enough to secure your booking or your catering. In future, we will confirm all the venues and catering by phone as well as email and follow up one week before the event is going to happen to make sure everything is going ahead as planned. 

It’s important to remain flexible so that hiccups like this don’t derail the whole event. Good preparation will avoid, or at least mitigate bad situations from happening, but sometimes you need to go with plan B. 

In short:

- Confirm your bookings over the phone and by email. Make sure you get a written notification that your booking has been received. 
- Call each venue the week before the event to make sure the booking still holds.
- Be flexible when things change at the last minute.

##Tip 6. Don’t wing it.
As the day of datamovida approached, I became acutely aware of how many plates were spinning. We were planning on taking 30 people to four different venues and at each venue we had to make sure we had refreshments, a screen and projector, wifi, and a PA system. 

To make sure the whole thing ran smoothly and on-time, Laura, Liuba and I sat down to write a detailed schedule for the evening. We knew at what time each talk would start and end, how long we would spend at each stop, and how long each section of the walk would take. Bathroom breaks got factored in along with the fact people walk slower when they are part of a group. 

Once we had our timings, it became very clear that some military style planning and coordination was needed. We had a group of willing volunteers who wanted to help out on the night so I split them into small advance parties, with two or three people in each one. Those parties were then assigned a venue to look after and given a box full of equipment and refreshments that had be taken by taxi to the venue. Upon arrival, the advance parties set up the equipment and made sure the space was ready for the guests to arrive. When the talk had finished and everyone else had departed, the advance party would then pack up and make sure no-one had got left behind. (Luckily no-one did). 

We also assigned eight people to guiding roles. These people walked with the guests between each venue and told them stories about the city and our work, using a script prepared by Jamie who had researched the history and stories of Madrid. Everyone was fully briefed on their role the day before the event.

To make sure everyone knew what was happening at all times, we set up a whatsapp group. This meant the advance party could send us a message when their venue was ready, and I could send a message to say we were on our way. Having a whatsapp group became really useful when we fell behind schedule as it meant I could let the next venue know what was happening and where the group was.

In short:

- Make sure you have everything each speaker needs at the venue at which they are speaking. This includes wifi, screen, projector and PA system.
- Factor in time for people to use the bathroom at each stop.
- Factor in an extra 5-10 minutes walking time between each venue as groups tend to walk more slowly than someone on their own. 
- Assign 2-3 people per venue to take equipment and refreshments to the venue, set everything up, and then tidy up afterwards.
- Assign a group of people to act as guides and prepare a script of interesting information for them. 
- Brief everyone fully the day before the event so they know what their role and responsibilities are. 
- Set up a whatsapp group and add everyone in the vizz team that is involved in the event.

##Some other useful tips
###Invites.
Invites were sent using nvite. 
The IODC speaker list was mined for interesting-sounding people to invite.
Craig sent an email after the event to thank everyone for coming.

###Photographer.
We hired a photographer to take photos of the event. This is probably the thing I am most glad we did because Beatriz captured some fantastic memories for us and the photos were a big hit on Facebook and Twitter. 

###Name tags.
We made name tags for everyone.
The tags used first name only and gave the name of the organisation that person works for. 

###Hookers. 
In the British navy they call the people who escort guests from the front door to the dining room ‘hookers’. At datamovida we had people filling this role and it meant we could properly welcome the guests and show them the way from reception to cinema room. 

We also encountered another type of hooker on our walk in Madrid. Although we had done our best to avoid the red light hotspots, we had an unexpected encounter that we were able to laugh off with promises that it hadn’t been our intention. 

##Lessons Learned/ how to improve next time
**I would go to Madrid sooner.**

There is nothing like being there in person to ask for people’s advice and scout out venues.
Finding the right venues took longer than expected, start scouting asap.

**I would avoid trying to plan anything over the summer holidays.**

Almost everyone took a long holiday over the summer and they were really busy with work before and after it. This meant almost all the planning happened in the six weeks preceding datamovida, making it more stressful.

**I’d have started organising datamovida sooner.**

Related to the last point, I should have set out the timeline and re-organised the to-do list sooner. 
Everything would have been less stressful if the venues had been booked sooner and the invites sent out earlier. 
I think my lack of event experience meant I didn’t appreciate how big this task was and how long it would take to make certain decisions (e.g. venues, invite list, branding etc) 

**I wouldn’t assign hosts.**

Before the event I assigned three guests to each of the guides. 
The idea was that these guides would keep an eye on their guests but in practice this didn’t happen  because it was too complicated to coordinate during registration). 
The group is small enough to keep everyone together and ensure everyone feels welcome.

**I would have given the photographer a better brief.**

The brief should have said what we wanted Beatriz to take photos of, what style we wanted, and what kind of filter/editing we wanted on the photos. 
Beatriz did a great job but when she turned up she wasn’t sure what to do and Carlos (our PR person) came to me asking for more directions on what we wanted. 
The final photos had grainy, dark filter which I thought looked good and felt right but not everyone agreed. When we do datamovida in Washington (or elsewhere) we should think about what we want to capture on film and how we want the photos to look. Should they be more glossy? Should the colour be lighter to reflect the spring season? 

**I should have checked Beatriz’s portfolio.**
This is crazy, but I never checked Beatriz’s work before hiring her. She was recommended by David’s wife and I trusted her opinion but that was not a sensible business decision. 
Always check someone’s portfolio before hiring them and don’t hesitate to ask your teammates if they recommend any suitable qualified people. 

**Should we have hired a videographer?**
We considered hiring a videographer for the event and even though we decided not to, I still wonder if we should have. 
Capturing the talks on video would mean we could re-watch them and use them in blogs, on social media, and as marketing collateral. 
But, the logistics would have been tricky given we went to four very different venues.  

**Swag**
Next time I would insist that we get t-shirts. There was a moment when we weren’t going to order any but I am so glad we got them.
The t-shirts looked fantastic and made it clear who was on the vizz team and who was a guest. 
I wore my t-shirt to IODC and having the vizzuality name on my clothing was a way for people to open conversations with me and recognise I worked for vizzuality. 

**Twitter**
I wish I’d checked which account I was tweeting from before I started tweeting on the night :-/  
Otherwise, it was a good move to live tweet from the event.

**Starting on time**
If we ever do another datamovida in Spain I will remember that everyone turns up late in Spain.
No-one arrived on time. 
We started late and we had a tight schedule. 
Lie when you tell people what the start time is. 



# Ice Breakers

## Useful for. 
Meeting some new colleagues, getting everyone to talk and helping create a happy, excited, creative air. 

## How to do it.

There's a number of different options available, here's some of the ones we've used in the past.

- **Introduce a colleague.** Each person, in turn, has to introduce the person to their left. 

- **60 second drawing a partner**. We put the names of every participant in a hat. everyone picks a name from the hat, then has 60 seconds to draw them. We collect all the papers at the end and we have to guess who was drawn

- **20 circles drawing exercise.** Each person is given a blank paper with twenty (or even 30) identical circles drawn on it. In a certain period of time, they have to draw as many things (baseball, pizza, world) as they can in each circle.

- **Post-it paper airplane**. Each team has to make a paper airplane that will fly farther than their opponents' out of post-its in 3 minutes. The catch, they can't communicate with each other verbally. After time is up, a rep from each team comes up to the stage to fly their plane.

- **Rock paper scissors tournament;** if you lose (best 2 of 3) you have to become the winner's biggest fan in the next round. By the end you have two people battling with about 15 people cheering for them. 

- **Jeopardy** - select a random word (using wikipedia random function) and say it aloud to the group. That is the answer, but we don’t have a question. Each person takes it in turn to suggest what the question could be. So for the word ‘Apple’ questions could be “how did the witch kill snow white”, “what’s the richest company in the world” or “what’s my least favourite fruit”...

- **Exquisite surrealist cadavers** - this exercise is about creativity and teamwork. Everyone has a piece of paper folded in 3 parts going down the page. The first person draws on the top fold. They then pass to the next person with the top half hidden; they draw the 2nd piece without knowing what they’re adding to. They then pass to the next person with the top and middle hidden; they draw the third piece. They finally pass to a fourth person, who has to describe the ‘thing’ that has been created. 

# Improper Behaviour and Harassment Guideline

  (*) This Guideline was initially presented to the company in a [blogpost](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/improving-attitudes-improper-behaviour-and-harassment-policy-123238) (17/03/21), and then in an email sent to every employee (ADD DATE)

** Guideline Content:** 

 1. Purpose 
 2. Scope 
 3. Key Concepts (*What do we mean when we say? Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Stalking, Bullying, etc.*)
 4. Preventive Measures 
 5. How to address and process a concern?

## 1. Guideline Purpose

  

This guideline shows our **commitment to keeping all work environments free of harassment and improper behaviour, so our team feels safe and happy**. We do not tolerate any intimidating, humiliating or sabotaging behaviour at the workplace.

  

Any type of intentional discrimination based on age, gender identity, sexual orientation, economic status, seniority, ethnicity, race, religion and disability is prohibited. This behaviour is targeted and sanctioned accordingly to what is described in this guideline and the applicable law.

  

All members of Vizzuality must work together to ensure a healthy working environment in which personal dignity is respected, and specially more senior team members, must actively ensure that no harassment occurs at the company.

  

## 2. Scope

  

This workplace harassment guideline **applies to all employees, contractors, external visitors, customers and anyone with whom employees come into contact at work**.

  

**Third-party companies** with which Vizzuality works will be informed of the existence of this guideline and in the event of any conflict between Vizzuality’s employees and any external contractor, or its employees, the corresponding business coordination mechanisms will apply, which trigger reciprocal communication to reach an agreement on how best to handle and resolve a discrepancy.

  

It also applies to **all countries** in which the company operates or has employees, and it will be **in place as from March 22nd 2021**.

  

It applies in the workplace and/or during working hours and outside the workplace during work-related events, trips or social occasions and via social media.

  

## 3. Key Concepts

  

To better understand the different concepts involved and their severity, the guideline’s key elements are described below: **Harassment, Sexual harassment, Gender-based harassment, Stalking and Cyberstalking, Mobbing or Bullying, Trolling and Online hate speech**

  

### 3.1 Harassment

  

Harassment is an *unwelcome conduct (physical, verbal, non-verbal) that creates an environment that is intimidating, hostile or abusive*. This behaviour could include bullying, intimidation, direct insults, malicious gossip intended to humiliate, and victimisation.

  

Some examples of harassment include:

  

-   Intentionally sabotaging someone’s work.
    
-   Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature.
    
-   Commenting derogatorily on a person’s age, gender identity, sexual orientation, economic status, seniority, ethnicity, race, religion or disability.
    
-   Starting or spreading rumours about a person’s personal life.
    
-   Ridiculing someone in the presence of others or singling them out to perform tasks unrelated to their job against their will.
    
-   Abuse (verbal or online).
    
-   Seriously offensive physical gestures.
    
-   Images, emojis, and/or graffiti with hostile, abusive and/or intimidating content against others.
    

  

### 3.2 Sexual harassment

  

Sexual harassment is *unwanted sexual behaviour (physical, verbal or non-verbal)* which:

  

-   Has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity.
    
-   Has the purpose or effect of making a person feel intimidated, degraded or humiliated.
    
-   Has the purpose or effect of creating a humiliating, intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.
    
-   Interferes with a person’s work performance.
    
-   Uses a person’s submission to or rejection of such conduct as a basis for employment decisions affecting that person.
    

  

**What do we mean when we say “unwelcome behaviour”?**

  

Unwelcome behaviour is *any sexual or gender-based behaviour that a person finds personally offensive*. It could be:

-   **Verbal behaviour**: such as sexual advances, requests for favours or pressure to perform sexual favours, obscene comments or gestures and/or any other verbal or physical sexual conduct, made either explicitly or implicitly, such as inappropriate sexual jokes, insistence in taking part in social activities outside work –once the person in question has clearly expressed that he or she is bothered by this insistence–, undesired telephone calls, jokes or comments about sexual appearance, etc.
    
-   **Non-verbal behaviour**: such as showing images or other material of a sexual content, lewd or lecherous conduct, coarse gestures, offensive sexual-related letters or emails.
    
-   **Physical behaviour**: such as unwanted and deliberate physical contact, undesired embraces or kisses, unnecessary or excessive physical contact.
    

  

It is not necessary to have previously objected to someone’s behaviour for it to be considered unwanted, and how a person receives and responds to the behaviour will determine whether that person finds it unwelcome.

  

If a person finds a conduct unwelcome, he or she should not hesitate to make his or her reaction known, clearly and promptly.

  

### 3.3 Gender-based harassment

  

For the purpose of this guideline, gender-based harassment is *any behaviour intended to belittle a person, attack his or her dignity or create an offensive or intimidating environment as a consequence of the employee’s gender or sexual orientation*.

  

The following behaviour, for example, is deemed to be gender-based harassment, if it relates to a person’s gender or sexual orientation and is aimed at attacking his or her dignity:

  

-   Deliberately ignoring or excluding a person.
    
-   Unfair treatment or assessment of a person’s work.
    
-   Inappropriate jokes, comments or banter or displaying inappropriate pictures or other material related to personal traits. This is harassment even if it is not aimed at the person who perceives it as creating an offensive working environment. An example would be a personal assistant who, in the course of his or her work for his or her manager, comes across pornographic material or sexist jokes in emails between managers.
    
-   Physical conduct related to personal traits; such as physical violence.
    
-   Excluding, marginalising or discriminating a person for reasons relating to a personal trait or unfair treatment as a result of a personal trait (even as a result of pregnancy or maternity), for example when taking decisions on his or her professional development or training, his or her continuity in the job, remuneration, promotion or any others.
    
-   Repeatedly entrusting tasks and duties that are clearly below one’s professional capacity because of personal traits.
    
-   Subjecting someone to humiliating or embarrassing situations for reasons relating to a personal trait. For example, singling out an individual for unfair personal criticism or ridicule in a team meeting for reasons that relate to their actual or perceived sexual orientation or age.
    

  

### 3. 4 Stalking and Cyberstalking

  

**Staking** is defined as *a pattern of fixated and obsessive behaviour which is repeated, persistent, intrusive and causes fear of violence or engenders alarm and distress in the victim*. Stalking behaviour includes:

-   Making unwanted communication.
    
-   Consistently sending gifts (e.g. flowers).
    
-   Damaging property.
    
-   Physical or sexual assault.
    

  

**Cyber-stalkers** are driven by the same intention as non-digital stalkers (i.e. to intimidate or embarrass their victims). The difference is that the latter **rely on technology such as social media, instant messaging and emails for their actions**. Cyber-stalkers can use a multitude of online tools to make unwanted contact with their victims. There are different types of online stalking, including:

-   Catfishing.
    
-   Virtually visiting victims via Google Maps Street View.
    
-   Hijacking webcams.
    
-   Looking at geotags to track a person’s location.
    

  

### 3.5 Mobbing or Bullying

  

For the purpose of this guideline, mobbing is *any type of offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, an abuse or misuse of power through means intended to undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient, committed by one person or group of people towards another person in the workplace*, which:

  

-   is of extreme psychological violence;
    
-   is abusive or unfair;
    
-   is recurrent and occurs for an extended period of time; and
    
-   damages the person’s dignity.
    

  

Some typical features of bullying are:

  

-   Extreme psychological violence.
    
-   The target is usually discriminated against because he or she is competent or popular.
    
-   The target may not realise they are being bullied for weeks or months. The target will often suddenly realise that a series of seemingly insignificant incidents amount to intimidation and victimisation.
    
-   It tends to be characterised by a series of minor criticisms or false or unfair allegations (offensive words are less common than in harassment).
    

  

The following is some typical mobbing behaviour:

  

-   Intimidating, threatening, malicious or insulting behaviour;
    
-   Mocking or criticising co-workers because of nationality, political or religious beliefs, sexual orientation, appearance, etc.; or
    
-   An abuse or misuse of power intended or which, viewed objectively, would be likely to manipulate, undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure a co-worker.
    

  

**Mobbing does not include legitimate, constructive criticism of a person’s performance or behaviour**; an occasionally raised voice; a disagreement; or reasonable instructions given to someone in the course of their employment relationship. In other words, **certain unfriendly or even hostile behaviour may occasionally take place at work**. However, in order for such behaviour to qualify as mobbing, **it must be aimed at one person in a malicious and recurring way**.

  

### 3.6 Trolling

  

A troll is internet slang for *a person who intentionally tries to instigate conflict, hostility or arguments in an online setting*. 

Trolls like to cause mischief and suffering and relish the attention it brings. Trolls often use inflammatory messages to incite emotional responses from people, disrupting otherwise civil discussions. Trolling can occur anywhere where people can freely post their thoughts and opinions (e.g. YouTube, forums, chat rooms).

  

Trolls will frequently try to attack something you have revealed you like or are in favour of. Trolls generally insult your tastes directly or generally bash the topic of a forum or post.

  

### 3.7 Online hate speech

  

If a post is hostile towards a person’s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, it may be viewed as hate speech, and, if serious enough, may be against the law, whether it is on- or offline.

  

A single “hate incident” may not automatically be against the law, but a series of hate incidents may amount to a criminal offence. Online hate speech is serious and is a crime if it targets one of the aspects of identity listed above.

  

## 4. Preventive Measures

  

Vizzuality has disclosed and will continue to disclose this guideline through our own **Playbook** (or any other means that serve that purpose).

  

Vizzuality will **inform all current members** of its organisation of the existence, purpose and application of the guideline, and will share it with every **new employee joining the organisation**, as part of their work contract. We will be doing this using different comms channels (ie. Blogpost, Slack Announcement, Email, Playbook Guideline, New Joiner Onboarding Handbook)

  

In addition, Vizzuality undertakes to promote respect and consideration among all its employees, fostering any action it deems necessary to fulfil the purposes of this guideline (i.e. culture workshops).

  

This guideline will be **updated from time to time**, so as to update it and ensure that all members of the organisation are conscientious and responsible for helping ensure a working environment in which the dignity of others is respected.

  

## 5. How to address and process a concern?

  

**At Vizzuality, we cannot guarantee a conflict- or concern-free workplace. What we can do is make sure we have a process and tools in place for us all to be in a position to prevent this type of behaviour.**

  

**5.1 Formally report inappropriate behaviour**
    

  

You can formally report improper behaviour to any of the following people:
    

-   **People & Culture / Human Resources**: feel free to reach out to HR/People & Culture to alert of any case of harassment no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact HR/People & Culture as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your Senior Manager / Exec Team point of contact is involved in your claim. In this regard, please contact Sebastian Bueno.
    
-   **Senior Manager / Exec Team**: if customers, stakeholders or team members are involved in your claim, you may reach out to a Senior Manager / Exec Team member. This person will assess the situation and may contact HR / People & Culture if appropriate.
    

  

**Concerns should be communicated in writing**. Please provide as many details as possible about your concern (i.e., identify the person being harassed, the harasser and yourself; the hierarchical relationship of the person/people involved; provide a description of the facts, actions or incidents in as much detail as possible, including the dates and places where the behaviour took place; also identify any possible witnesses).
    

  

The more information you provide, the sooner, more efficiently and thoroughly we will be able to address the issue. The reporting person should receive confirmation that the report has been correctly received within seven days of it being submitted.

  

Where the information provided in a complaint does not suffice to assess the facts, the Investigation Committee may decide to open a prior information procedure. This process will last a maximum of ten working days and, once completed, will end with the Investigation Committee’s decision to open the investigation procedure or close the complaint, in which case it must reason its decision.
    
All the information provided is confidential and will be treated as strictly confidential.
    

  

**5.2 “My Obligation - If I have been informed..."**
    

  

We are all responsible for preventing and stopping harassment and inappropriate behaviour at the workplace. If you know, or have been informed, of any such behaviour, you are responsible for addressing the issue as soon as possible.
    

  

This does not mean that you have to resolve the incident yourself. It means that you should act promptly and report the incident as soon as possible upon finding out about it whenever possible so that we can proceed as explained below in accordance with our obligation to protect the wellbeing of everyone at the organisation.
    

  

**5.3 Workplace investigation**
    

When we find out, either orally or in writing, about potential harassment or improper behaviour it is our job and obligation to investigate. If the investigation uncovers a violation or infringement, we will promptly take appropriate action. Our goal is to create a safe and respectful work environment in which we call all perform at the best of our ability.
    

Follow-up action will take place and feedback provided within a reasonable timeframe, given the need to address the problem promptly and avoid unnecessary public disclosures. This timeframe will not exceed three months unless the complexity or exceptional circumstances may .
    

  
Every situation is different and how we (the Investigation Committee handling your concern) approach your concern may vary. However, we generally follow the following steps during an investigation:
    

**a) Creating an “Investigation Committee”** (formed by 4 objective and impartial members who are not involved in the situation) who will mediate, review the information and store any evidence, as well as issue a conclusion/recommendation. The Committee will keep the identity of all the parties involved confidential and all members will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before joining.

Investigation Committee Members:


-   **Permanent:** People & Culture, 1 Exec Team member.

-   **Depending** on the case and circumstances, permanent members of the committee will be choosing 2 more members from across the organisation which are not involved, are impartial and are also objective to the situation.


**b) The Investigation Committee will collect all relevant information to get a full picture**. The committee will also draft minutes of all the conversations, testimony and/or interview. These minutes will have to be signed by the speakers.

**c) Talk to the two (or more) people involved**. Here, the parties can present their case, defend themselves and provide evidence.

**d) Review** documents, emails, messages, etc. provided by the parties.

e) If necessary, **other people who might be able to provide relevant information to the case might be contacted**.

f) The person under investigation will have **10 calendar days** to provide evidence to defend him or herself against the facts he or she has been accused of.

g) **Other people** may be contacted or other information reviewed at the request of the parties.

(*) If you have been requested to **act as a mediator**, additional support is available [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zk2OfKAvEW08GwDKgB1UeG8qhIYqFwHQ_6u3_JRY91I/edit)

    

  

**5.4 Confidentiality and data protection**
    

  

While we strive to provide a safe space where people can raise concerns, both Senior Managers and HR/People & Culture have an obligation to address workplace concerns as and when they arise.
    

  

**All inquiries are confidential, and although information is only disclosed on a need-to-know basis, we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality and some or all the information may need to be disclosed to investigate and resolve the concern.**
    

  

As we collect information, we may discover that there are other people we need to talk to or documents we need to review, which can lengthen the process. We will do our best to give you a timeframe of when you can expect us to get back to you.
    

  

The procedures in this guideline comply in full with the applicable data protection regulations, in particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and Basic Law 3/2018 of 5 December on protecting personal data and the digital rights guarantees ("Personal Data Law") (specifically, article 24.2).
    

  

The unauthorised disclosure of any information or data resulting from a harassment or mobbing procedure is a breach of contract subject to disciplinary sanction. In addition, Vizzuality will deal with the data resulting from a harassment or mobbing procedure in accordance with the Personal Data Law.
    

  

Our aim is to make the procedure as swift and efficient as possible, while protecting the privacy, confidentiality, dignity and data protection rights of the people involved. Sufficient protection of the victim’s safety and health will also be sought, taking into account the possible physical and psychological consequences that may arise from the situation, with particular regard to the working circumstances in which the person allegedly harassed may find him or herself. In this respect, the company will offer the victim agile and effective protection measures to ensure that the person in question is removed from the situation of pressure or harassment.
    

  

Strict confidentiality will be maintained throughout the procedure and all internal investigations will be carried out with caution and due respect for both the complainant and victim – who must not be treated unfavourably for this reason – and the person against whom the accusation is made, whose guilt will not be presumed.
    

  

Access to the data contained in the internal investigation processes is limited to those who carry out the functions of internal control and compliance, or those in charge of processing that may be appointed for such purpose. Similarly, access to them by other people will be lawful, including their communication to third parties, when necessary to adopt disciplinary measures or take legal proceedings as appropriate, pursuant to article 24.2 of the Personal Data Law, or to the competent public authorities (including law enforcement authorities) when appropriate or required by law.
    

In accordance with the above, all people involved in the procedure must be identified in the file and must keep all the information confidential and secret. They must not transfer or disclose information on the content of the complaints filed, under investigation or even resolved, except as expressly referred to in article 24.2 of the Personal Data Law. If a breach of this confidentiality obligation is detected, the disclosure will be investigated and if the source can be determined, the applicable penalties will be imposed.
    

  

Simbiótica, S.L. is the data controller of the personal data collected through incident reporting and processed during investigations. The data (including but not limited to data regarding the people involved in the harassment or improper behaviour reported, the potential harassment or improper behaviour itself or the dates and places where the reported harassment or improper behaviour took place) will be processed with the purpose of managing and investigating the reports, establishing corrective measures and complying with legal obligations. The legal basis for this processing is (i) Vizzuality’s legitimate interest to create and maintain a whistleblowing system to prevent any potential harassment or improper behaviour in the company and (ii) to comply with legal obligations.
    

  

Moreover, personal data will be processed during the following periods:
    

-   In order to carry out a prior analysis of potential harassment or improper behaviour reported to determine whether an investigation is necessary, data will only be processed for as long as necessary to determine whether the reported behaviour needs to be investigated. In any event, the analysis will not exceed three months as from the moment the behaviour is reported.
    
-   If an investigation is not initiated, personal data in the reports will be immediately destroyed and the reporter will be informed accordingly. If the investigation is recorded using digital format/tools, it will be enough to delete the personal data and information. Therefore, records could be anonymised (ie. to delete the personal data included within) so the full records are not deleted.
    
-   If an investigation is initiated, personal data will be processed during the investigation and, then, for as long as necessary to avoid the liability arising from the reported conduct.
    
-   If the reported harassment or improper behaviour constitutes a crime regarding which judicial proceedings must be initiated, personal data will be processed during the judicial proceedings, and then, for as long as necessary to avoid the liability arising in this regard.
    
-   Data subjects involved in the investigation can exercise their data protection rights (i.e. right of access, to rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, object, to not be subject to automated individual decision-making, and any other rights) by communicating so to the following email address: [ david.gonzalez@vizzuality.com ]. The request must include proof of identity. Notwithstanding this, in order to preserve the confidentiality of the personal data of the people involved in the report (e.g. information regarding the reporter), some limitations on the above mentioned data protection rights apply, especially regarding the rights to access and rectification. Additionally, please note that data subjects have the right to file a complaint with the corresponding data protection authority, which in Spain is the Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos) ([www.aepd.es](http://www.aepd.es)).
    

  

**5.5 Presumption of innocence and contradiction** 
    

  

All people involved in the procedure must be treated fairly and given a fair hearing. The objective must be to uncover the truth and clear up the facts.

  

**5.6 Retaliation**
    

  

Vizzuality prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports, in good faith, an existing or potential breach of this guideline or pursues any claim relating to this guideline or against anyone who co-operates in a related investigation. However, disciplinary measures will be taken against any person who makes a false accusation solely to harm another person.

  

**5.7 Conclusion and recommendations**
    

  

Once the Investigation Committee looking into your concern has collected the information required, they will need to reasonably conclude what they believe happened and whether any policies were violated. These conclusions will be recorded in a formal report.
    

  

The report will include at least the following information (which will be kept confidential):
    

-   Background to the case (summary of arguments raised by the parties involved).
    
-   Summary of the Investigation Committee’s involvement and evidence collected.
    
-   Summary of the main facts.
    
-   Conclusions and, where appropriate, proposed disciplinary measures.
    

  

The Investigation Committee will then work with HR/People & Culture and the appropriate business leaders to offer recommendations on what actions to take.
    

  

Behaviour involving sexual harassment, harassment on the grounds of sex or mobbing are very serious offences. **If disciplinary measures and corrective actions are deemed appropriate, they could involve coaching, a verbal warning, a written warning, lower performance ratings, lower compensation, demotion, suspension, transfer or contract termination depending on the particular case.**
    

  

If the disciplinary measure is not a dismissal, the company will take action to ensure the parties involved are kept apart in order to protect the victim, while also respecting their working conditions at all times.
    

  

**Applying this guideline does not prevent the people concerned from simultaneously or subsequently taking any administrative or legal action deemed appropriate.**
    

  

**5.8 Post Conclusion & Recommendation “What if…”**
    

  

If you feel you are suffering retaliation for raising the concern or participating in the investigation, we also consider this act inappropriate and will not tolerate it. Please let HR / People & Culture know immediately.
    

  

We will do our best to have HR / People & Culture check in with you to see how things are going after a concern has been resolved, but if anything else happens – similar offensive behaviour, other offensive behaviour or anything else that bothers you – please let us know. You can do so by reporting your concern as explained above.
    

  

We want Vizzuality to continue to be a great place to work, and we take workplace concerns very seriously when they are brought to our attention. If you witness or experience something that does not quite feel right, please speak up.

# Decision Making

## Introduction

This is a proposal for a decision making system at Vizzuality. The goal of the proposed changes is to empower individuals to make decisions, because we trust people will make the best decisions.

We arrived at it by reviewing our current decision making processes and identifying their weaknesses. We researched systems used in other organisations to design our own.

## General criteria
If you have a decision that affects other people and has a risk attached to it you need to start the decision process by:

- checking existing guidelines;
- using the **advice process** to make decisions;
- using the **consent process** to develop new guidelines.

## Exclusions
Some decisions are legally required to be made by the shareholders of the company and are therefore excluded from this system. Those are any decisions that put the company at risk of bankruptcy / legal issues or affect property right of shareholders.

Examples:
- Selling the company
- Company going public
- Changing the status of company
- Very big investments

## Guidelines

Clear, concise and easily accessible Guidelines are paramount to the efficiency of the decision making process.

Guidelines have a hierarchic form with Purpose at the top. Vision and Strategic Priorities are the next level.

Next, we have broad organisation guidelines, like conflict resolution, resource allocation, information flow, feedback loops and decision making.

Finally, at the base we have functional domain guidelines, e.g. project workflow, quality standards, technical documentation.

![decision making guidelines - guidelines-detail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/134055/43250703-dcdeb1c6-90b5-11e8-98a5-4499b6e8e81c.png)

Maintaining good guidelines will allow us in many cases to take decisions independently, taking into consideration their scope and impact.

In absence of a specific guideline we should look for a relevant higher-level guideline. The guidelines themselves can be modified using a collective decision making process, as described later.

## Scopes & Risk

Another pillar of the proposed decision-making process are the criteria to apply when classifying the decision and processing it through the proposed framework.

### Scopes

The first dimension according to which to classify the decision is its scope, understood as people affected by the decision. We have identified the following scopes:

- Company

  Decision affects everyone in the company directly or indirectly.
Many of these decisions will be covered by organisation guidelines, for example:
    - To bid on a project - vision & strategic priorities
    - To open a new office - resource allocation
    - To dismiss someone - conflict resolution
    - To carry out a performance review - feedback loops
    - To disclose salary brackets - information flow
- Office

  Decision affects everyone in the office. Similarly to company scope, many decisions here will be covered by organisation guidelines, for example:
    - To grow the office - vision & strategic priorities / resource allocation
    - To buy equipment - resource allocation
- Functional Domain

  Decision affects everyone within a functional domain:
    - Backend
    - Frontend
    - Business development
    - Operations
  
  Many decisions here will be covered by functional domain guidelines, for example:
    - To establish communication channel with client - external communication
    - To start working on a project - project kickstarting
- Project team

  Decision affects everyone within the project team. Similarly to functional domain scope, many decisions here will be covered by functional domain guidelines.

  Because of the overlaps, a decision made in this scope is typically covered by functional domain guidelines with a possibility of feeding back.

### Risk

The second dimension according to which we can classify a decision is the impact it has on the company. Put simply: "What negative outcome will the decision have for the company if it goes wrong?"

We could consider an number of types of risk associated with decisions:

- Strategic - e.g. investing in technologies that quickly become obsolete
- Legal - e.g. running services non-compliant with GDPR
- Financial - e.g. buying expensive equipment that turns out to be faulty
- Reputational - e.g. losing a contract with an influential client

A risk assessment (high vs low) will help understand how much advice and dissent to encourage in the decision-making process.

## Framework

We propose the following framework for making decisions.

![decision making framework proposal v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/134055/43250785-0efdf4a0-90b6-11e8-8b52-9eb99cd93a0e.png)

There are broadly 3 paths a decision can go through:

### Decision based on existing guidelines

> IN SHORT: If there is a sufficient guideline that covers your proposal, you can make the decision right away.

**sufficient ≠ specific**

**can ≠ have to**

The easiest path is where a decision can be taken simply based on existing guidelines. This path will help reduce the current decision overload.

** EXAMPLE PROPOSAL**: To buy new mugs for the office

- **Guideline sufficient?** YES (Guideline: you can spend up to X euros from the office budget)

- **Follow guideline?** YES

- **DECISION** I will buy new mugs for the office

### Decision based on advice process

> IN SHORT: If there is no guideline or you choose not to follow it, you have to start the advice process. You can follow the advice.

**can ≠ have to**

Where an appropriate guideline does not exist or where it exists but the proponent believes it should not be followed, they initiate the advice process.

1. Express the proposal. Provide justification. Document it. Assess the risk and define the scope (upper-most for high risk).
2. Conduct due diligence. Are there any known constraints (financial etc)? Are there any contradicting decisions already in place?
3. Everyone in the advice process can voice their opinion but it does not need to be followed.
4. Anyone in the advice process can call the need for guideline creation / amendment, and becomes responsible for leading it.
5. Decision can still be passed while guideline change process takes place. Consider the risk assessment to decide.

**EXAMPLE PROPOSAL** : To go to a conference X

- **Guideline sufficient?** NO (Guideline: you can use a personal training allowance of up to X euros per year but you must consult with peers / manager)

- **Advice process**

  - My proposal is to go to conference X to learn about Y.
  - The risk level is low (based on cost) and the relevant scope is the functional domain + manager.
  - I checked I have sufficient funds in my training allowance.
  - I checked that the dates don’t coincide with any known events.
  - I consulted with peers in my functional domain and my manager. One of my colleagues noted there is another conference Z that might be better for me to go to.
  - Nobody called the need for a more specific guideline.

- **Change guideline?** NO

- **Document decision outcome**:
I documented the expected outcome: I will learn about Y in the conference, which will be useful for upcoming projects, and report back in the form of a lightning talk for the functional domain team.

**DECISION**
I will go to conference X.

### Guideline change based on consent process

> IN SHORT: If anyone in the advice process raises the need for creating / amending a guideline, that person has to start a consent process. You can wait for that process to be complete.

**can ≠ have to**

A process to change guidelines can be started where existing guidelines are deemed insufficient. This is carried out using the consent-based ("no principled objections") process, loosely based on Holacracy.

1. Express the proposal. Provide justification. Document it. Assess the risk and define the scope (upper-most for high risk).
2. Open the proposal to everyone in identified scope for a round of clarifying questions.
3. Set a time frame for a round of reactions.
4. A proposal cannot pass if it is blocked. It can pass if people disagree. A block is a principled objection, which needs to be explained and further discussed to either withdraw the proposal or amend it allowing the block to be resolved.

**EXAMPLE PROPOSAL**: To bring dog into the office

- **Guideline sufficient?** NO

- **Advice process**

  - My proposal is to bring my dog into the office to reduce my stress levels and get a better work-life balance.
  - The risk level is high and the relevant scope is the office.
  - I checked there are no contradictory health and safety regulations we have to comply with.
  - I consulted with peers in my office. One of my colleagues has an allergy.
  - One of my peers would like to bring a cat. They called a need for a general guideline about bringing animals to work. They started a company-wide consent-based process.
  - I will not pass the decision without the collective process, because the risk level is high.

- **Change guideline?** YES

- **Wait?** YES

- **Consent-based process**

  - The proposal is for everyone to be able to bring animals into the office.
  - The scope of the proposal is company-wide.
  - After the round of clarifying questions the proposal was amended to say "for everyone to be able to bring well-behaved animals into the office"
  - In the objections round the proposal was blocked by a person with an allergy.
  - The proposal was then amended to say "for everyone to be able to bring well-behaved animals into the office, provided no-one in the office has allergies".
  - This proposal passed and this became a guideline.

- **Document new guideline**

- **Guideline sufficient?** YES

- **DECISION** I will not bring my dog into our office because we have people with allergies there.

## Responsibility

Document your decision process and your intended outcome.

If a decision fails, we don’t start blaming anyone. Instead we use a review process or retrospective to understand what happened, why, and how we can improve next time.

Do a retrospective when the intended outcome was not achieved.

Include the people who were involved in the decision process and the people who were affected by the outcome.

For example, everyone has to say three things that went well, and three things that could be improved next time. Learn from each other.

## Online tools to support decision making

To address the issue of lack of transparency in current decision making process, we need a tool / set of tools available to everyone, which will allow us to:

- Organise guidelines in an easily navigable and searchable format (to support "Predefined process for guideline creation / modification" in the diagram)
- Document outcomes of decisions (to support "Predefined process for documenting decision / guideline exception" in the diagram)
- Organise people according to the scopes they belong to
- Facilitate the advice process (group consultation)
- Facilitate the consent process (company wide voting)

## Links to other systems

The operation of the decision-making system relies on guidelines and processes coming from other systems. This allows the decision making flow to remain simple and not necessarily concerned by potential issues arising from misuse, for example:

- Bad decisions are made? - feedback loop
- People bypassing the system? - feedback loop
- Opposing interests surface? - conflict resolution
- Decisions leading to overspending? - resource allocation
- Insufficient transparency? - information flow

# **Conflict Resolution.**

In this guideline we want to outline some guidance to help you prevent conflict in the first place, then some steps you can take when you have a conflict you want to resolve.

## Main principle.
_If you have a conflict you should resolve it. If you detect a conflict you must help the people involved. The responsibility for resolving our conflicts as a company, is shared._

## Prevention.

1. We use the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) process. This means being open to talk about times when our strategies violate or don't fulfill our colleague's needs. This means focussing on needs and objective things, not opinons. 
2. We don’t blame problems on others. If something doesn't go as we planned, it's a chance to learn and improve 
3. We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions  
4. We don’t spread rumors
5. We don’t talk behind someone’s back
6. We focus on strengths

### More information onthe non-violent communication process.

At a series of workshops in May 2018, we all got the chance to learn the non-violent communication "dance". This involves going through a number of steps, with yourself on one side and the person who you have the conflict with on the other. 

1. Start with the situation. What is happening right now?
2. What are your thoughts? 
3. Observations; objective facts that you can 
4. What are your emotions/ feelings? Does this situation make you feel happy, sad, angry? 
5. What are your needs in this situation? Comfort, support, communication? 
6. Strategies. What strategies can you use that will meet the needs of both people? 

## Resolution.
If you find yourself in conflict with a client or a colleague, follow these steps

0. Go through the NVC process to identify yours and the other person/people/project/situation’s needs. See if there is a new strategy that meets both people's needs. Then implement it! 
1. If this does not solve the issue, or you'd like to discuss the problem in more detail with the person then sit with them 1-to-1 and sort out the matter privately. Again, use the NVC process to help find a strategy that works for all; listen before talking. 
2. (internal) If you can't find an agreeable solution then nominate a colleague that both parties trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather they support the participants to come to their own solution
2. (external) If you have an external problem with a client and they couldn’t find and agreeable solution, they should raise their hand and approach the PM or other team members.
3. If mediation fails, the mediator has the responsibility to create a group of mediators (perhaps a group 3 people) who will then try to come up with an agreed decision

** Detecting Conflict **
Successful conflict resolution depends on people being aware of the conflicts they may create, and raising awareness about conflicts they're suffering. We encourage Vizzuality staff to seek a dialogue between colleagues - if you're not comfortable doing this in person, you could skip straight to step 2 with a trusted colleague. 

** Learning and Sharing **
We would like to propose a monthly session where staff can explain conflicts they or others have had, and how they were resolved. These sessions are important to help us all learn and prevent future misunderstandings or conflicts.

## Coming soon.

Next steps for this group include
- Setting up the monthly sessions
- Setting some guidance for mediators
- Train mediators/ build a conflict resolution committee
 	

# Vizzuality Guidelines

The “Vizzuality Guidelines" include the information and agreed practices that govern our work at Vizzuality. The purpose of this methodology is two-fold. First, for new staff this should provide the knowledge required to understand how things work here. For existing staff this serves as a reference when you need guidance or when making a decision.

## Intro

In this section of our playbook we intend to establish a common work methodology for project management and describe our typical project life cycle. The goal is to optimize the way we work and standardize the procedures, as much as possible, so that every person is familiar with it. Moreover, by creating a common process, we are bringing transparency and clarity to our practices and with it enhancing the way we care and support each other. This is also meant to be the central hub for all relevant templates and guidelines. Thus, hyperlinks to those documents are highlighted whenever it applies and are listed under a joint glossary.

## Project life cycle

Independently of the diversity of our projects, we like to follow a common approach and process so that we can optimize the way we work together. To attain this consistency within the company, it is important that the whole project team understands and follows the different project phases and the most important rituals a project entails. Under this framework we intend to create the conditions that pull people into greater levels of development, performance and accountability. With this structure we can also enhance the performance and feedback culture that will allow us to grow individually and as a team.

  

### What are the project phases?

In a standard Vizzuality project, we typically have 8 phases:

-   Proposal writing - under BD responsibility
    
-   Kickoff - organized by BD and the PM
    
-   Discovery - project team
    
-   Design - project team
    
-   Data processing - project team
    
-   Development - project team
    
-   Launch - project team
    
-   Retrospective - led by the PM
    
-   Support and maintenance - optional phase, led by the PM
    

  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1ZoB5EFm0ClbcJ8yR8pAbaV0uChdiSR0IwDG4f0n26XWFEr1GG8zc3vsSW5zKMHI6a0t6dG-iNcry9cF0IjZvo15PjhVBsrmS-zquuVFbBDcM-GG7M5w5T9Tmum43aSbdSLdJyqT)

### What is a ritual?

A ritual is a formal “space” within the project life cycle to make things explicit, agree, document, review and learn from each other. There are two main rituals in every project life cycle: the kickoff and the retrospective. Together they form the performance loop, since on the first ritual we agree on how to work together and we define individual responsibilities, and on the second ritual we revisit those commitments and pledges and explore ways to improve. Formalised feedback loops improve performance and growth. Feedback and evaluation are not simple admin or bureaucratic tasks that we do just to check a box. They are key components for the solid construction of a learning and high performance culture. We need the entire team to know them, understand them and readily apply them.

This is why, independently of project or PM, kickoffs and retrospectives should be run in similar ways. Not only will all of us know what to expect and what to do, but, having a shared notation system, makes it easier for anyone outside of the team to compare projects and analyse them.

  

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sMKMGx34J1pvlzZfZAzMAJIx0d2P3gNixMyqQlQedqhxLFvw4TUfe0M074dtnt6JV11JPPZQBHfrQDJVk44-4U4igxdlg4kjOPFSSga63le-dQpV30DfzFUFOCUNfDkEXvoQjCCF)

### Elements of the rituals

When we perform a kickoff of a new project, and later on its retrospective, we have 3 main elements to combine: our functional area social contract (what we agreed to offer as a functional group), our individual roles and agreements (that defines who does what at an individual scale) and our growth perspective (what new skill/experience can be or was achieved).

-   **Social contract** - is something that doesn’t change with a new project, it can be revisited for sure, but for the lifetime of a project, this is rather a static document. [add links to social contracts]
    
-   **Kickoff** - To define and agree. At this stage we should share agreements for the Vizz team working on a specific project (Who, what, when, how). This is documented on the welcome doc “roles and agreements” table during or after the kickoff meeting (see the specific kickoff section on this playbook). Some of these agreements are also important to be shared with our clients, so this is a good moment to think that through.
    
-   **Retrospective** - To fix or close and learn. In general, we try to answer the question: are we collectively doing a good job contributing to our purpose? And we try to find out if there is a specific process that should be triggered internally to ameliorate our way of work or to grow. On the other hand, a retrospective also gives us the opportunity to think if there was something nice and interesting that happened on the project that is worth sharing with the broader Vizzuality team. (See the specific retrospective section on this playbook)
    

  

## Project evaluation

Project evaluations are a way to inform the decisions we make by critically assessing our work. Thus, all projects should be evaluated by Vizzuality and the client. These evaluations are meant to track project quality and client satisfaction, as well as to identify growth opportunities and improve individual and team performance.

Our projects can be assessed both internally and externally. In both cases, we mostly want to understand the project performance in 3 main pillars: time, quality, and experience. However, from an internal perspective, we should also reflect on our processes, as well as new business and learning opportunities.

### Criteria to perform an evaluation

Time

-   We know if the deadlines were kept or not, but it is important to detail:
    

-   Why did the delays happen?
    
-   Did they have a big impact on the client? On Vizz?
    

Quality

-   It is important to define since the start of the project what is quality. For different projects we might have different quality criteria and that is important to have in mind.
    

-   Added value (at what level? Innovation? BD? Other?)
    

Experience

-   Here we have several subgroups:
    

-   Satisfaction
    
-   Communication & feedback loops
    
-   Perspectives for future work (for the client)
    

### Available tools

-   Project evaluation - [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13zBAfqjm5TBhR1XrXNj5Nsa4Cw2TOrk3vfxmksHzqAk/edit#slide=id.p) and [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDEsECPodZ36kFKGqorLylCL_YdQN5GmN3f0JJwoKV8/edit#heading=h.p2sbfb6nose9)
    
-   Kickoffs - [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wz61sa7mX_9zgc2Hzy4PqgwUBf5TdN9IhnbFYfZfipk/edit) with initial agreements
    
-   Retrospectives - [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vyxs5XmK5xaFaFJHr43X_aqauWjAm93tcQj4d5i_tec/edit#heading=h.p2sbfb6nose9)
    
-   An internal survey - [questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18srPtUxf0WN3C9LCkP_J116HqlL0egyktlv3_EgDWkw/edit)
    
-   A structured interview with the client - [script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Chkh-u72Vwp1npXMUQD1wVrsZHZcOFHZEX4KOljV1nA/edit#heading=h.p2sbfb6nose9)
    

### Outcomes

Once we obtain all insights from our team and from the client some  action points should be defined. These should be identified and shared with the entire project team by:

-   Signaling it on the Slack channel;
    
-   Saving all documents on the retrospective subfolder;
    
-   Writing a Blogin to share general conclusions with the whole company (use the retro tag)
    
-   Alerting Exec and/or BD if critical issues have arisen.
    

  

## Project documentation

All information about our projects is kept in [VizzTracker](https://vizz-trackr.herokuapp.com/) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ycjuPMQYsD1rke-edupftI6GCHLlpWWS).

  

### What can I find in VizzTracker?

Just as the name implies, VizzTracker is where we keep track of our work. It gives us a quick picture of the financial health of a project, but it is not only about numbers, it also intends to centralize all project related materials. BD is responsible to create new project/contract entries and PMs will update them monthly.

  

Tip: mind the difference between project and contract in VizzTracker. The contract is the actual work unit of a project. One project can have several contracts, but one contract only belongs to one main project. For the sake of our daily use, the contracts page is what we should look at.

  

For each contract we have access to:

  

-   Project start and end dates
    
-   Relevant links - here is where we centralize all information for location of google drive folder, gitbub, pivotal tracker, Invision, etc.
    
-   Project total budget
    
-   Estimated progress - based on tasks completed.
    
-   Cost to date & income to date - based on time reports and progress.
    
-   Budgeted and reported time breakdown per functional area
    

  

### How do we organize our projects in Google Drive?

We keep all our projects documentation inside Google Drive. All projects main folders are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ycjuPMQYsD1rke-edupftI6GCHLlpWWS) and a direct link to it can also be found on the sidebar of VizzTracker.

  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qr_9vEybNif_8bZ_pEZy_vDdOKPK8aguY0rZhNm4QCuSGPOT_z29I-dlodLctQVEm9pJq1fDAvf4KNpxl6Z6Bi4cGChPovA4BPNH6mp7pZRmssq4BwUMtmUX17kF66Gn7tUCkX2U)

  

Each individual project respects the same organization of folders. The PMs are responsible for creating the project main folder (which you can access by entering the project page in VizzTracker), but everyone must collaborate to keep it tidy. Every FA is responsible for keeping their own space up to date. E.g. Design folder - invision links referenced, style guides, etc. Try not to keep any ongoing work on your personal drive, everything project related, even work in progress, should live in the project main folder.

  

#### What is inside the project main folder?

A standard project folder will include:

1.  Proposal & Admin - here we put contracts, budget, link to proposal and other admin materials.
    
2.  Onboarding - this is the go to folder when we start working on a project, thus important documents to understand the basics of a project, like the welcome doc, timeline or kickoff agendas will be kept here.
    
3.  Discovery - all research related items should be kept in this folder.
    
4.  Design
    
5.  Data
    
6.  Development
    
7.  Launch
    
8.  Retrospective
    
9.  Shared folder - in case we need a folder to be shared with the client. Otherwise, use the SHARED prefix to individual documents located in other subfolders, it also works.
    
10.  Internal notes doc - to keep a record of our internal meetings so that all team members can always be up-to-date.
    
11.  Client notes doc - to keep a record of all our meetings with the client. These notes may be shared with the client (if marked SHARED) or not.
    

  

## Reporting

At the end of each month everyone at Vizzuality has to fill in their report with the % of time they have spent working on each contract that month. Non-billable activities such as operations or vacation should also be reported. So at the end of the month your report should sum up 100%. This information keeps track of the cost of each project and allows us to check if we are within budget or if some corrective measures need to be put in place. These reports are NOT intended to be used as a timetracker software. For this we usually use Tmetric, but ask your PM if the project you are working on has any specific time tracking tools.

For cost tracking purposes on VizzTracker, we consider that 5% is roughly equivalent to one day of work. You should disregard bank holidays and different months length, as well as your own dedication time, since this is already calculated by the app. Other guidelines for reporting can be found in the i button of the VizzTracker reporting page.

  
  
  

# Phases.

## Acquisition & proposal writing

Budget template - always use the original template. This template is updated every 6 months or so to reflect the current exchange rate USD/Eur and our internal rates.  
  
A new project may start in different ways as explained on the [BD workflows document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OT8KCznUvRtp6hyFw9xHkJm8SsEFq2CrrepQA19ycc/edit#). There are also different proposal types, and a PM or members of other FAs might or might not be asked to participate in its writing (see different examples [1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Ng0Aj2ZPSxPVyIOSHM89Qso8TE_KTsVZ7d7bNaWSNg/edit#heading=h.hga7orl2o4xf), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_DuIzCT-l8EF_P9ez4mPJVAAKYmmMyk8etEsZcpA9Q/edit#heading=h.jglb0h8ylt24), [3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2qLKPsaSDltCt3oL6w8WP99Rq7lUCKXRwSt_oQ5k_0/edit), [4](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jJeGjm9TuyoNEIk_3kjPUCTO8ZpHsG8g)).  
This phase is led by BD. Most times a PM is already designated to a proposed project and ideally if the project is approved that PM will be following it through. At this phase it is important to use the  proposal template [[link to proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17YyO8Km30We5Invp3wEdZvzEIhX7EXUPCeTuPF0lLcA/edit#heading=h.co06jg4rdozj)] and budget template [[link to budget template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x5_nwT3nD-IFfilcRd1rgtYx4p3RS9Zf2KnsJ3qTXyo/edit#gid=0)] to apply a similar reasoning, buffer times and rates throughout projects. always use the original template. This template is updated every 6 months or so to reflect the current exchange rate USD/Eur and our internal rates.  Once the proposal is accepted the client will send out a contract draft that must be reviewed.

  

## Kick-Off

The kickoff and project onboarding is usually a crucial part of the project. This phase goes after the contract signature and it is a moment where we establish many of the conditions and expectations of the project. This phase definitely defines how the whole project is going to develop.

  

Preparation

1.  As soon as the contract is signed, BD and the PM will fill out the welcome doc [[link to welcome doc example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wz61sa7mX_9zgc2Hzy4PqgwUBf5TdN9IhnbFYfZfipk/edit#heading=h.5ap5r0qtreo8)]. It is important that the PM, together with the team, revises the proposal and any other documents the client may have shared. At this stage we will coordinate internally on how to organize ourselves as a team (communication tools, frequency of meetings, etc). This is also the moment to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of every team member.
    
2.  Each member of the project team reviewed the welcome doc in advance of the Kick-Off session to understand both the “Big Picture / Purpose” and also the more specific “deliverables and jobs to be done”.
    
3.  Based on the “Team Pledges & Agreements Template Table” present on the welcome doc, each member of the project team starts thinking on their Responsibilities, Impact and Growth.
    

### Kick-off sessions

INTERNAL

In this event, we’ll introduce the project to the whole team and we should get some outcomes. The  welcome doc [[link to welcome doc example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wz61sa7mX_9zgc2Hzy4PqgwUBf5TdN9IhnbFYfZfipk/edit#heading=h.5ap5r0qtreo8)]. covers also the questions and aspects to be covered during the internal kick-off.

1.  During the internal kick-off session, the PM will ask each member to share initial ideas about what their role and responsibilities will be.
    
2.  Team members allowed 2-3 days to fill out the table “Team Pledges & Agreements” in the welcome doc.
    
3.  Once the table is completed, everyone reads and comments. It is the moment to identify role overlaps and other inefficiencies.
    
4.  Role owner to modify and update if needed (Self Set Targets, Ownership)
    
5.  PM to facilitate a consent round to the Plan. “Does anyone have an objection?”
    

  

EXTERNAL  
At this point, we have enough information to set up a good client meeting kick-off (This will be documented). Before this, we should make sure we have the welcome doc and the project starter kit updated with the particularities of this project.

1.  Share project starter kit [[link to project starter kit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EkuCe9OEgqktrPmONVhIJ0kVnP8Sp9sbZFKCvHDH7o/edit#heading=h.f39wzun7o02r)] with the client (if applicable: e.g. new client).
    
2.  Prepare and share with the client external kickoff document [ [link to external kickoff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mVEXI-3HZ75gBEwrz_2Rae4waiVSni-K3oDNRboRn68/edit#heading=h.rv9rdq7rke5s)].
    
3.  Create a project on Basecamp, Pivotal Tracker, or other communication channels. Template for the welcome message to basecamp [[link to welcome message here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_UDROGjBsdClhhHUMuTzXkUtgHldsLmL5JsbMHd_KD8/edit)].
    

  

### Documentation

It’s of primary importance to keep up to date documentation in Google Drive for all the areas involved. This will help any newcomer to join the project. Every participant in the project is responsible for maintaining his/her documentation in the project main folder and alerting the PM if something needs to be linked to VizzTracker. Something like:

-   Designers should put the link of the latest design and wireframes into the Design folder of the project and this link should be also in VizzTracker.
    
-   Data scientists should put relevant links to notebooks or keep an updated spreadsheet with data sources in the Data folder of the project.
    
-   User researchers owners should keep up to date their docs into the Discovery folder of the project.
    
-   Developers should write the links of all Github repos in a google doc in the Development folder of the project and on VizzTracker, as well as technologies and frameworks.
    
-   Developers should document the Github Repos properly, how to create the environment, how to deploy, dependencies and special procedures should be kept up to date.
    
-   PM should document any important change or exception to the SOW in the welcome document.
    

  
  

### Profile’s Onboarding.

If someone is coming to the project. It’s time to have a meeting and talk about the project. The PM together with other team members should meet, give a project description, explain technical solutions, and ask for opinions from the newcomer. At this point, we should have up to date documentation enough to make a proper onboarding with the welcome doc, tasks management software, and information from the meetings.

## Discovery

Once the ground rules are established between our team and the client it is time to start the work. The first step is usually a discovery phase. Taking into consideration that the PM needs to be always aware of everything happening and should (somehow) sign all the plans This phase is led by user researchers and designers, but also involves data and tech discovery. It will vary according to the project, but below we highlight the most important things to take into account. The PM will be moderating discussions, gathering conclusions and setting next-steps or to-do lists.

  

### Success definition

-   Define what the project needs to achieve.
    
-   Refine the timeline according to tasks.
- Revise the [Quality Cheklist](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/implementation-default/).
    

  

### User Research

-   Read previous research documentation (if existent).
    
-   Prepare a summary of that research (if existent).
    
-   Prepare interviews (if needed).
    
-   Prepare conclusions document.
    
-   Prepare conclusions document.
    
-   Prepare persona and use cases document
    

-   [[Link to Design Sprint Guidelines](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/design-sprint-guidelines/)]
    
-   [Link to [Stories and acceptance tests](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/stories-and-acceptance-tests/)]
    
-   [Link to [Quality checklist](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/quality-checklist/)]
    
    

### Science discovery

-   Understand the datasets to be used, propose data analysis and complementary datasets
    
-   Set up data meetings (if needed).
    
-   Start filling the data status document [[link to the data status](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ywUCsJM19VIkAl1Bfwod0Vn1Ae-J1Fu9AEaxRQBhXBA/edit#gid=0)].
    

  

### Tech discovery

-   Understand the adequate tech to use and prepare a tech specifications document [ [link to tech specification document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16L5DdG_ZRUbmmgLqS7TjQfPqnCMLgQXkbCI8jw5tsBo/edit#heading=h.6xo3r7chl811) ].
    
-   Prepare the FE scope document [[link to FE scope document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m820LDhwWEjxaOwDW7XFrWYZ_bDIsGnwiQsnTZDG5Ww/edit#)].
    
-   Prepare the BE scope document [[link to BE scope document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZH8IYfHk446Fxsy3JRj_Fx53Wqlpxj79m4z-FbIgA0/edit)].
    

  

### Feedback

-   Meet with the client.
    
-   Validate target users.
    

## Design

After having a good understanding of what the client wants to achieve and the main user that is to be targeted by the platform the design phase starts. This phase is led by designers and involves a lot of iteration and co-creation. However, it is the PM job to make sure that we do not deviate from the scope and that we still keep the project on time.

  

### Wireframes

-   Create the first ideas (low-fi prototyping).
    
-   Ask for input from the Scientist to clarify necessities (brainstorming).
    
-   Production of dummy figures/sketches for the wireframe.
    
-   Share with clients and collect feedback.
    

  

### Design Sprint

-   Prepare a design sprint (in-person or virtual).
    
-   Create a summary of the sprint.
    

  

### Visuals

-   Create visuals (high-fi), branding guidelines, etc
    
-   Share with clients and collect feedback.
    
-   Post conclusions of feedback on basecamp.
    
-   Post conclusions of feedback on basecamp.
    

  

## Data Processing

Data processing and ingestion will probably crossover several phases of the project. That is why the science team member should always be in close contact with both the designers during the discovery and the developers during discovery and implementation, to guarantee that the solutions we find are suitable for the data types we will process. The PM can serve as an intermediate to talk to the client or simply moderate the data conversations to make sure there aren’t any blockers that will affect the project.

  

### Data digestion

-   Receiving the final data from the client; Transforming the data to serve it to the Front End; Fill out the Data status sheet
    
-   Provide code of the methodology in GitHub (Science repository) [Documentation]
    

  
  

### Data Storage

-   In collaboration with the Back End determining where the data will be stored.
    
-   Fill out any database models explaining the relationship between datasets.
    

  

### Communication materials

-   Prepare communication materials to explain the process to the client.
    
-   Prepare communication materials to complete the website or in close collaboration with the data person on the client’s side.
    

  

## Development

Once the design and the visuals are ready and approved by the client it is time to make the magic happen. Developers will start building the application usually using sprints of 2 weeks. Working in cycles also offers the opportunity to provide feedback early, so we avoid situations where major rewrites are required. This can be two-way as developers might also identify areas where further discussions are needed. The PM job in this phase is to facilitate a good communication between the different functional areas and, as always, to make sure we keep the timeline, scope and quality of the project.  
  
The development process characteristics will depend on the project but this are the implementation defaults [link to [Implementation default](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/implementation-default/)]

  

## Launch & Ahead of release

The launch is the official release of the project (platform). In this phase we must consider the hand-over period and warranty both in terms of time length and activities included.

-   Checklist (TBD).
    
-   Comms (TBD).
    

-   [Analytics](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/project-workflow/adding-google-analytics.html)
    

  

## Retrospective

At least after handing over the final deliverable and issuing the last invoice, it is time to take a step back and think of how the project went. We should consider both the client’s opinion and our internal team reflection. Note that retrospectives can also be done after important milestones or if there are issues with the project.  
To set up a retrospective meeting see some guidelines [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vyxs5XmK5xaFaFJHr43X_aqauWjAm93tcQj4d5i_tec/edit). Consider doing an internal retrospective or also inviting the client to this meeting. It all depends on the objectives we have in mind. Regardless of the format, we should always ask the client for its feedback. The PM should adapt the methodology to the type of project and client to perform an evaluation.

  

**Preparation**

  

1.  Ask for a facilitator to moderate the session. And ask BD to be present.
    
2.  Make sure everybody knows the subject and the objectives of the session, sharing the agenda, and some key points beforehand.
    
3.  Each team member to revisit the “Team Pledges & Agreements” [link to team & agreements template table] in the welcome doc, to keep them in mind for this session.
    
4.  Optional - each team member fills out a form [[link to form example](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18srPtUxf0WN3C9LCkP_J116HqlL0egyktlv3_EgDWkw/edit)] before the retrospective, to summarize project satisfaction. If necessary, BD can collaborate, and fill in the BD questionare for the project [[link to BD questionnaire doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d5j2sZ2rLmLGdocaNlNGYmqykON0lOufuwQyk3OKuOE/edit#heading=h.wg5uderowod1)]
    
5.  Also, you can gather independent and specific information from the client in the form of a survey or interview [[link to client’s interview script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Chkh-u72Vwp1npXMUQD1wVrsZHZcOFHZEX4KOljV1nA/edit#heading=h.p2sbfb6nose9)]. And get some information about the clients satisfaction [ link to [Client Satisfaction](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/client-satisfaction/)].
    
6.  Add up the project evaluation little description/mention.
    



### Retro sessions

As we said, the structure and development of the retrospective are flexible so the PM should adapt the methodology to the type of project and client when doing the retro. But you can use the guidelines [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vyxs5XmK5xaFaFJHr43X_aqauWjAm93tcQj4d5i_tec/edit) for help and inspiration. While doing a retro some good practices are:

-   Keep positive communication and have the key principles in mind.
    
-   Make sure to reach out to introverts.
    
-   Keep the time and stick to the structure.
    
-   Write clear and achievable action points.
    

### After

PM to write a summary of the main ideas and action points. Keep documentation in the Retrospective folder, inside the project main folder in Google Drive, for everyone easy access and tracking. It is also a good practice to share conclusions with the whole company via Blogin.

  

One of the most forgotten things is to follow up on the action points after a retrospective. It is ok to not have some action points for some of the issues found during a project, the main goal of a retro is to find improving points in order to act on them, not just to point or mention.

  

## Support and Maintenance

In some cases a project might have a maintenance and support contract. These activities can be divided into 3 groups:

1.  Corrective - will be applied when a problem is detected with a response within 48 hours if the issue is not critical, within 24 hours if the issue is severe, and within 4 hours if the issue is critical.
    
2.  Preventive - will involve periodic revision of servers, codebase and updates to guarantee security and performance.
    
3.  Evolutive - consists of some analysis and activities focused on finding areas of improvement for the usability and the quality of the platform.
    

  
  

## New contract

Throughout the project, but especially towards the end, it is important to start conversations with the client about possible new contracts. A new contract will have a defined timeline, budget and scope, even though it will be associated with the same project. We must not drag things from old contracts into new ones.

This will start the same process with (possibly) the same phases we've seen, depending on necessities for the new contract for the project.

  

# Glossary

All templates listed in one place (TBD).

# **Retrospectives.**

# Thinking back to do better

This document aims to be a set of guidelines, do’s and don’ts for us to follow and be best aligned in how we run retrospectives. 

## Purpose.
Looking back is always a good way to learn and improve from our experience. 
The main objective of a retrospective is to improve the way we work together, but below there is a list of more outcomes you can get. 

## Outcome from a Retrospective.
- Review our processes.
- Detect areas of improvement.
- Detect issues in the project to solve them before they go wild. 
- Detect good things we want to keep.
- Align team members. 
- Identify new opportunities for future phases.

## When should you do a retrospective?
We don’t need to reach the end of the project or come to a place where people seem to be detached from the project to run a retrospective. 
Run a retrospective: 
- At the end of the project. Wait some days after the release but don’t postpone it too long. A week after the release seems like good timing. 
- When a milestone has been accomplished. Such as when an ongoing project has had a clear release, or at the end of the quarter / six months...
- You feel things are not working the best they could while we are working on the project. 

# Process for a Retrospective.
There are millions of ways to run a retrospective. Below is a procedure we have tested many times in different situations but you can adapt as needed. 
Here you have some general ideas you might want to take into account: 

Prepare the session in advance. Look for a quiet and private space. Be sure you have the tools you need and people know what this is about so they can get ready for it. If there are people joining remotely, think about the technology you need. 

Ask someone to be the facilitator. That person will make sure everybody talks and express their ideas. Also, they will take notes during the session and will develop the conclusions document. The facilitator can be someone in the team or a special guest but in any case, that person will need background information about the project to better follow the conversation. Ideally they would not have worked directly on the project, so they can provide an outside perspective.

For larger groups, consider to ask someone else to take notes besides the facilitator. 

Make sure everybody knows the subject and the objectives of the session. You can send an email beforehand and always go through them at the beginning of the session. 

Make sure to be positive in communicating. It’s about sharing what we could improve next time, in positive way we can learn from. It is not about blaming anyone or going into negative discussions. The goal is to improve, not to annoy people.

Make sure to reach out to introverts. Not everyone is comfortable speaking to groups, so use your means to involve them, by asking questions and putting them at ease; ignoring them is not a good idea. 

Keeping up positive language and stressing the fact we are doing this to learn from ourselves can help to create a better atmosphere. As suggested in the project evaluation document, getting the team to answer some questions ahead of time (using a survey) could also help people contribute. 

Make sure to keep to the time and be organized. Set a “schedule” for the retrospective to ensure it moves forward. Depending on the number of participants, the duration of the session can be around 1.5 or 2 hours. 

Make sure the action points are clear and achievable so that they can be done!

Stress also what worked well during the project. It is also good to reinforce what we do well to keep it for the next time. 

Tell the whole team what happened so we can all learn from the experience

## The classic retrospective... 

# The setup
This is an example of how to run the restrospective that has work in the past. 

- Invite everyone involved in the project to take part in the retrospective;
- Invite someone that was not involved in the project to coordinate the retrospective;
- If the discussion group is larger than 6 people, think about inviting someone to come as lead note-taker.
- Book a room to do the retrospective for between 1 hour to 2 hours depending on the size of the subject at hand;
- You might want to get some snacks so people can eat while they chat (makes for a more relaxed environment);
- If you are the coordinator, ask everyone to think ahead about the focus of the retrospective and add their ideas to a shared doc (you might want to use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14CqpvNFVATPjhLoj--Ognf902Fr6GaKZxDQE4pEQ_yU)) before the Retrospective meeting. Set a limit of ~160 characters per comment to force people to express one idea at a time. Take into account those ideas will be presented later during the meeting and they can explain further then.

1- Think of up to three things that that we could&#39;ve done better to avoid each of them. Add them to the shared doc

2- Think  of up to three things that went well and how we could keep them the next time. Add them to the shared doc

3- Think about something that you, personally, could&#39;ve done better to avoid unpleasant situations. Add them to the shared doc.

- If you set up personal Pledges at the beginning of the project, ask team members to think about how it went. 

- People can keep their comments anonymous if you prefer.

- The coordinator should arrange all the comments and create a presentation to be followed during the meeting. It is useful to arrange them by topics as well. (You can use a Trello Board)

# During the retrospective

1. Welcome everyone;
2. Identify what the retrospective is about and what the goal of the meeting is;
3. Identify the facilitator of the retrospective and let them have the floor;
4. Identify the note taker if any.
5. To include everybody in the conversation, you can start by having a quick round asking each team member &quot;How do you feel today?&quot;
6. Start the discussion following the comments previously shared.
7. Drive the conversation to identify actions to avoid the same issues in the future.
8. If you notice some people are not speaking much ask open questions to the quieter ones to make sure everyone has a chance to speak. Where people are speaking too much, mention that (&quot;I&#39;d like to hear from some others in the room&quot;)
9. Action points to tackle the priorities are identified;
10. Thank you and see you next time!

# After the Retrospective

*Distill actions*

After the meeting, coordinator will take all the notes and create a document with clear actions that will help us to improve our processes.

Think about naming a responsible person for each action and a potential deadline if that makes sense.

*Pledges*

Ask each team member to create a &quot;Pledge&quot; for themselves and add them to Bamboo as objective for the quarter. This way, we ensure individual commitment is tracked.

*Guidelines review*

We might detect areas of improvement of our guidelines. If so, be sure you name a responsible to update them. 

*Long term review*

_[This is a Work In Progress still]_

Every year, a couple of volunteers will review all those documents (_create a folder and link it here_) to see if there is any evolution. Where we see common issues that need improving, or some &quot;things to keep&quot; that should be shared, there&#39;ll be a all-company presentation during all-hands to start a discussion, and a working group can form to amend or improve relevant guidelines.

# Very important things

- Make sure to be positive in communicating. It&#39;s not about not sharing what went wrong, is not blaming anyone and not going into negative discussions. The goal is to improve, not to get people annoyed;
- Make sure to reach out for introverts, not everyone is comfortable speaking to groups, so use your means to involve them, by asking questions and putting them at ease; Ignoring them is not a good idea;
- Make sure to keep to the time and organized. Set a &quot;schedule&quot; for the retrospective to ensure it moves forward;
- Make sure the action points are clear and achievable so that they can be done!

# Final Thoughts
As we said before, retrospectives can be run in many different ways, here you have some links for inspiration: 
A more playful schema: http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/check-in-questions
An idea to mix-up with feedback: http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/feedback-start-stop-continue

A couple of things we thought in our last retrospective (Half Earth):
- Make people ask themselves at least one thing they’ve learnt!
- Linked to this idea that everyone committed in the Kick-off meeting they were going to learn while working on this project, it would be nice to see the progress and let them talk about it.
- It would be nice to ask people to assess and express one thing they could have done better in this project that will probably be turned into a commitment for the next project they start working on. 

Another couple of  things we thought in our last perspective (Worldbank):
- Just one hour might not be enough if the group is more than 4 people.
- Ensure everybody share their thoughts.
- It was a good idea to ask people to share their comments beforehand and organize them in thematic areas.

# **Purpose.** 

### **Vizzuality's purpose is to reach a fair and sustainable planet by creating tools that radically empower people to make positive changes now.**

This vision was accepted by consent in a whole-company workshop in May 2018. 

# Vision Statements

Vision statements are meant to be a more practical and measurable expression of the Purpose. Within five years, what would we like to achieve? It is intended that these statements help everyone at the company understand what we are aiming for, and also to help them make decisions about where to focus their energies. If you're doing a task and it isn't contributing to the vision, ask yourself how you can alter it so that it's helping us create the company we all want. 

We would like to propose four main visions for what we want to achieve in the next five years. 

1. 100 Million people are using our tools every year to understand the world and act to make it better

2. Our team is a unique assembly of capabilities and skills working together for a flourishing planet.

3. Our team is inspired by the projects we work on and we’re open and generous with our knowledge

4. Thousands of people follow us into a movement creating a more sustainable, equal and enjoyable way of doing business

An initial version of these statements was presented at Vizzcamp 2018, and using the feedback from the sessions and the comments coming out of the consent process we refined these statements. We received no blocking comments, only suggestions. You can see the initial statements, the comments we heard, and how we reflected those in our new visions, [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DW-VBXcWSFlFrvqnZUZALL4iT5G7tbxzXXBFUs23Dh4/edit)

## Strategic Priorities

We have two main priorities for the next six months. 

**1. Increase the urgency of our work and complete projects more quickly.**

Under this priority we will undertake five main activities

* The 6 systems we’re creating are built around increasing speed and quality and are consentmentized and operational by the end of 2018
* Build an organistional structure that empowers individual ownership of our work, rewarding positive behaviour and a drive towards our results	
* Build a strategy for better communication during meetings (including good practices and equipment)
* Hire staff with different skills/ backgrounds who can create new tools, data, research and ideas.
* Define internal training needs for our current staff to create new tools, data, research and ideas

**2. Win the largest, best, most impactful, and most profitable projects.**

Under this priority, we will undertake four main activities. 

* Work on 20 projects in 2019 with an average sized income of 200k (baseline is 32 projects with $103k average size)
* Win more grants to build our research team
* Extend our client base into Europe
* Investigate ways to change budget, rates, scope management or types of project to ensure we're setting ourselves up for profitability

**This is in order to double our per staff profit, so we're able to invest that new profit in more initiatives that achieve our purpose.**


## Additional priorities
There are a number of other strategic priorities that we want to focus on in the coming years. But we won't be able to do them until we've delivered these first two groups of priorities. Therefore we're using a classic Agile Backlog system. Once we have secured a greater source of funds for new initiatives, we will reopen the backlog and, using a consent process, include a few new priorities. [You can see these here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJvU3uYNN4lS_mKdvLH2CMji61G-P5vKIIHMrvnFEek/edit#gid=798446450) if you want to comment already

## **The team**


### **Roles**

**Product success accountable person**:



* Define the product vision.
* Add value.
* Represent the client.
* Define epics, milestones, and priorities.
* Grant the definition of done.
* Keep scope and budget.

**Project facilitation accountable person**:



* Coordinate events.
* Organize issues in Jira.
* Create and close sprints.
* Maintain the issues backlog.
* Supervise Jira's issues, their language, score, and other aspects.
* Follow the rules described in this guide, in general.

Project managers may delegate one or both of these roles. This delegation must be explicit, ideally, at the project kick-off or at any time if it might benefit the project.

There must also exist a** Technical Lead **to facilitate the integration of the project development. Activities for this role must include:



* Integrate source code repositories.
* Create a continuous deployment strategy for a dedicated testing environment.
* Supervise software versions and releases, including the deployment to staging and production environments.


## **Events**


### **The Sprint**

The default sprint duration is two weeks. It is possible to decide on a different timing if this is beneficial for the project at a given stage. Still, it is vital to avoid a constant variation because it will prevent learning the team's velocity and plan the sprints adequately.

It is crucial to avoid the inclusion of new tasks in the sprint or to iterate on the tasks that are in an active sprint.


### **The Project Meetings**

Attending a project meeting is mandatory for all members involved in a project. The meeting can include two of the following activity blocks; however, it is possible to hold a separate meeting for any of these specific events if needed.

In chronological order:

**- Backlog refinement -**

*Always before a new sprint.*
-   Discuss possible sprint goals.
-   Review user stories to clarify doubts, identify gaps, and add detail.
-   Discuss and agree on high-level tech solutions and update the tickets with necessary information regarding the agreements reached.
-   Estimate the effort of the user stories.
    
-   Split user stories if the estimation is too big to fit in a sprint.
    
-   Review backlog prioritization.
  
**- Sprint planning -**

*Always after backlog refinement.*
- Agree on the Sprint Goal (should be aligned with the roadmap)
- The team will include the User stories or tasks needed to reach the agreed sprint goal based on the team’s velocity.
- Start the sprint.

Once the sprint starts, the first activity will be the “task breakdown,” where the development team will create the necessary subtasks to reach the goals of each requirement (user story or task).

**- Current sprint status -**

*After first week of sprint (also daily if possible).*
- Track the progress of the current sprint.
- Discuss blockers, issues, and doubts.
- Discuss any potential risk for the sprint goal, including possible unfinished tasks.

**- Close sprint and Retrospective -**

*When the sprint has ended*
-   Review previous retrospective actions.
-   Sprint revision and retrospective.
	- Did we reach our objectives?
	- What went well, and should we keep doing it?
	- Is there anything to improve in the next sprint?
	- Agree on actions to improve.
-   New features demo.
- Review the project budget.



### **The Daily Meeting**

The Daily meeting is an optional event. The recommendation is to have daily meetings when the development process gains complexity, urgent delivery, or any other risky situation.

The daily meeting duration is fifteen minutes or less, having the principal goal of keeping the team synchronized and assuring the sprint success. It is essential to check for blockers and discuss the most efficient strategies to solve shared problems.


## **Working in Jira**


### **Setting up a project**

**Project initialization**

Users with the Jira admin role can set up projects. It is essential to follow the steps described here, to get all the correct configuration options. Simultaneously, not following these steps will add several unwanted artifacts to the Jira administration panel.



1.  Click on the menu item "Project" > "Create a project."
2.  Select "company-managed" project.
3.  Enter the project name and key. The project key is used as a prefix of the project's issues. The recommendation is to use a descriptive character combination.
4.  Mark the checkbox "Share settings with an existing project." This step is crucial; if omitted, please, contact a Jira super-admin at Vizzuality.
5.  Select "Template for Vizzuality Projects (TFVP)" on the dropdown list.
6.  Click on "Create."


![creating a project in Jira](images/create_project.png "creating a project in Jira")

**Setting up the project board**

The user must be part of the project's team to complete the following procedure. If the project board is not visible, this is probably the cause.



1.  Click on "Board name" (on the side panel).
2.  Click on the three dots of the upper right corner and select "Board settings."
3.  Add two new columns with the names "Blocked" and "QA."
4.  Drag the status cards "QC" and "Blocked" to their respective columns. These appear initially under the "In Progress" column.

The board should contain the columns “Blocked”, “To Do”, “In Progress”, “QA”, and “Done”, with their corresponding status cards inside.

![Scrum board](images/board.png "Scrum board")

### **Project roles in Jira**

There are the following project roles in a Jira project:



* **Administrators**: A project role that represents administrators in a project. An administrator has permissions for all the project settings and options.
* **Atlassian-addons-project-access**: A project role that represents Connect add-ons declaring a scope that requires more than reading issue permissions
* **Vizzuality Team**: Default project role for the Vizzuality team. This role has permission to operate with all the project functionalities.
* **Collaborator**: Project role for external developers. This role has the same permissions as the Vizzuality Team member, except sprint management and other minor details.
* **Customer**: Project role for customers. This role has permission to create and comment issues only.


### **Issues**

**Issue types**



* **Epic**: A big user story that needs to be broken down. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. In agile development, epics usually represent a significant deliverable, such as a new feature or experience in the software. Epics are also the milestones displayed in the Roadmap.
* **Story**: A user story is the smallest unit of work that needs to be done. It maps to a feature that the user can test.
* **Task**: A task represents work that needs to be done. The principal difference with a story is that a task does not map directly to a feature that a user can test.
* **Subtask**: A subtask is a piece of work that is required to complete a task. Subtasks issues can break down any standard issues in Jira (bugs, stories, or tasks).
* **Bug**: A bug is a problem that impairs or prevents the functions of a product.
* **Spike**: An investment to make a story estimable or schedulable.
* **Incident**: A System outage or incident occurred at a given moment.
* **Problem**: Track underlying causes of incidents.

**Writing issues**

Issues must be written descriptively and comprehensively. It is imperative to validate these criteria before adding a task to the sprint. In particular, for these fields:



* **Summary**. The summary must be short, but it has to offer enough context and information to understand the issue's nature and validate it without extra information. When it is a User Story, the recommendation is to place the user in the context, as in this example: "User can change the range of dates of data shown in the dashboard charts." When the issue is of type "task", it can be written in a straightforward and imperative language, for example: "Create the data migration to include the user roles."
* **Description**. The description is a longer text where all the details for the current task are written. This field may include links, steps to reproduce, minor details or edge cases, together with any other information that will clear any possible doubt to the issue assignee.

It is important to note that the "Summary" field equals the issue's description into the release notes. It must be meaningful outside the Jira backlog.


### **Story Points**

Story points are the way to represent the level of effort required to complete a given issue. These are the scores to use and their description:

**1**. This story could be easily done; I can do three or four like that one in a morning.

**2**. I know how to do this story. Some clearly defined steps need to be taken in order to complete it. I have done some similar stories in the past. I can do a couple or three stories like this in a day.

**4**. This story is quite significant; it involves several steps and touching a nice amount of code, files, views, designs. I am confident about how to do it. It should not take more than one day to do it, but it will benefit from a thorough peer review. It is not something that could be easily done with many context switching or intersperse communication.

**8**. This story is significant or complicated. Some communications between functional areas will be involved, and it will probably take slightly more than a day.

**16**. This story is complex and may take several days. We may consider splitting it into two or more if that is possible.


### **Sprint Planning**

A sprint should follow the following premises:



* The sprint must have a defined goal.
* Issues must contain a precise definition, both in the language and in the scope of work. If a task is not defined or is a candidate for iterations, it should not be part of the sprint; it is possible to write a spike issue to get a clear definition instead. If an issue is poorly described or the summary is not clear enough, it should be rewritten.
* Issues must have story points assigned.
* Issues must belong to a software version; it is possible to change this version later if the resulting feature is not ready for release within that version.
* Sprint candidate issues have a greater priority than other backlog issues. Product, client, or development needs, establish this priority.
* The team's velocity determines the number of issues included in a sprint. If there are no team velocity indicators yet, it is possible to consider setting a velocity goal and iterate in future sprints. The velocity goal is always prone to be improved.
* It is critical to check the individual's workload for a sprint, filtering by a given user and looking at the total story points. This initial indicator must be used in conjunction with the individual's appreciation, vacationing, absences, and project dedication.


### **Continuous delivery**

The technical lead will facilitate a continuous delivery system where the quality assignees can test all the issues when these take part in the "QA" column. This environment must be different from the production environment, and different back-end and front-end technologies may integrate the system.

Currently, projects which have a separate front-end CI/CD process use Vercel, in some cases only for development purposes, and in some also in production. For the back end, and for those projects with a unified BE / FE process, we use Jenkins, Capistrano, GH Actions, Travis CI, docker images, Code Climate (for test coverage).


### **Quality assurance**

**Passing issues to quality assurance**

There are three requisites to move an issue to the QA column:​



* The issue must be testable; this usually means deployed to a development environment. Developers are currently writing the strategies and guidelines for continuous deployment.
* If it is a user story, a user acceptance test is required in the form of Given, When, Then. There is a specific field for that into the Jira issue form.
* At least one reviewer must be assigned to the task.

**How reviews work**

It is possible to assign an issue for design, data, development, and acceptance test. Please, note that "development review" is not "code review," and it does not mean the acceptance of a pull request (as this procedure will take place in Github, as usual). The minimum for an issue to be delivered is to pass the "acceptance test." Still, it is also possible to add reviewers from different functional areas to check the feature using their vision.

Reviewers will get a notification including a link to the issue, where they may see the context make the checks for their functional area and try to pass the acceptance test (even if this is marked as "yes"). The first reviewer that finds a problem should leave a comment and move the card back to "in progress." There is no need for the other reviewers to look if one already found a problem. The issue assignee will get a notification, also the other reviewers.

The original issue assignee is responsible for passing the card to "Done" once all tests have passed. Remember that the user acceptance should pass too.


### **Releases**

Using software versions, we can have a collection of the issues that are ready to deploy. Just bear in mind that software versions are not sprints; one version may contain different sprints or the other way around. Software versions reflect the application state, not the progress.

Every release is attached to a software version; these are in Jira in the "Releases" section. It is essential to associate individual issues with software versions initially; this procedure leads to better control and defines release notes.

Release notes are the tool to keep stakeholders updated on the project status and the new functionalities incorporated with a new deployment. Allowing clients in the project backlog and board is exceptionally possible, but the common practice must be to use Jira to develop and not communicate.


### **Incident response**

Delivery of the sprint goal will sometimes be affected by responding to expedited requests, like incidents in production environments. The approach we take is that as we keep tracking the team's velocity, the effect of such incidents on sprint delivery will be reflected in that metric, allowing us to plan sprints more realistically.

Production incidents are the most obvious sign of low quality from the client's perspective, and we should strive to reduce their number of occurrences and criticality by better QA practices. To better understand the problem and see the improvements from our quality processes, we should track those incidents, particularly the time spent fixing them. We can follow these steps:



* Create an "Incident" issue, for that matter. This issue will help watch how many incidents happen; this type of task should not be seen very often, as having many of these is a clear indicator that something is not working as it should in the QA or development process. Log the work for this incident by clicking on the issue details, Activity > Work log > log work.
* Create a "Problem" task if the fault is structural and requires more than solving the incident (you can plan when you need to work on this later).
* Create a release just for the hotfix.


## **Definition of Done**

An issue is done when:



* It works as requested.
* It was tested, and it does not bring a regression.
* Others can see it.


## **Exceptions for this framework**

The framework described in this document must be adopted in every project; it is an essential part of our standardization process. There may be exceptions to satisfy the client or other stakeholders' demands for a given situation or when the project itself has justified requirements.

For these cases, it is possible to implement an exception both for the project framework and the Jira scheme. A dedicated meeting must address the possible solutions, including a Jira super-admin and other accountable persons.

​

# **Job Stories and Acceptance Tests.**

# Intro.

This document explains how Vizzuality uses Job Stories and Acceptance Tests to finalise project scope with our clients and deliver quality products. We will talk about three key elements:

* User Personas: a brief description of a key audience group that we want to target in a certain project.

* Job stories: a series of statements that describe specific interactions users will want to complete on the interface, and why. The ‘why’ is made up of the original context for visiting + what they’ll want to achieve afterwards. 

* Acceptance Tests: a series of scenarios describing how a tool may be used, so we can check it solves the problem we want to solve with the tool. They go into more detail about the scenario of the user. 

Each of these activities should be completed with the core project team, with responsibility for coordination and delivery attached to the Project Manager and User Researcher.

# Start with the Persona.

One of the first activities we do on any project is to ask "who is the target audience, and what do you want them to do on the tool". We usually summarise these discussions in a user persona document. Personas are ‘stereotypes’, representing the average user within a group. Usually we would focus on around 3 priority user groups: adding too many more means we could lose focus and compromise the user experience. 

Each persona should contain the following information:

* Name of persona

* Type of Organisation they work for/ sector they work in

* Seniority/ Job title

* Level of experience with the internet

* Level of experience with data visualisations

* Their responsibilities/ what do they do in a normal day?

* What barriers do they face to achieve their goals?

* Desires/ Needs: What will they want from the tool we build?

* How will they hear about the tool?

* How often will they use it? 

[There’s a template in the Google Docs gallery](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?tgif=d&ftv=1) that you can use to undertake this activity. 

Examples from our projects: 

* [Mozilla](https://docs.google.com/a/vizzuality.com/document/d/1nrx25Cn59ZIGFJCMV5NRhupypwKBkn_12O_zIRZbSB0/edit?usp=drive_web)

* [This work for Climate Watch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BMxoVtx54c0MYwCcIvxb0Z3ngJFHwoLRpGnmePMYNvg/edit#slide=id.p)

# Then write Job Stories.

Job stories are specific statements detailing which problems users want to solve using the  interface. We use Job Stories to drive conversations about what could be put on the site, and to make sure we create a number of solutions that will deliver real value to users. Our solution is ‘successful’ if it helps users complete these stories quickly and easily. Following these discussions we would refine the stories into a final list, which can be used to start writing acceptance tests (see below). 

Each statement contains three parts:

* "When I"...   - the Situation/ Trigger, why is the user coming to the tool? 

* "I want to"...    - Motivation: what are they trying to do on the tool? 

* "In order to".    - Objective/ outcome: what do they want to do once they’ve successfully used the tool?

Job stories should be written in the middle of discovery, once we have enough information about who may use the tool, what users want to try and do, the data and client expectations. Some guidelines include:

* Single Responsibility Principle: you should express only one problem in one story. 

* Written from the viewpoint of a user: if we gave the list of stories to a user, they would understand them. 

* Focus on problems: stories should not prescribe a specific functionality (user can see a graph) but a problem the user is trying to solve (I want to see change over time).

* Focus on Context: make sure you’re explaining why a user is coming to the site, what they’re trying to achieve and what comes next after they use the site. 

* Prioritise: share the stories with the client and complete a prioritisation exercise, to establish which stories are most important for us to work on.

The job stories can then be used throughout the project in discussions about project scope or comments on prototypes and design drafts. 

Examples:

*When I’m* writing a national report on the state of the environment, *I want to* find out the current status and change since 2010 for biodiversity indicators for my country, *in order to* complete the report faster and fill gaps in the data I have. 

*When I’m* writing a soy sustainability strategy for my company, *I want to* see how much of the soy we purchase comes from areas with low sustainability,* in order to *eliminate them from our supply chain. 

*When I’m* writing a 10 year strategy about water stress for my company, *I want to* see if any basins we rely on will suffer severe water stress in the next 10 years, *in order to* create plans to support growers in those regions and guarantee the supply of commodities into the future.

* [R4D nutrition project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/154RndawLKyVsp3yhRpS10jF0i9IaVlCF03UqOZam9rg/edit)

# And finally, Acceptance Tests.

Acceptance tests break down the job stories into even more constituent parts, providing clear statements about what interactions a user can complete on the interface. We should also cover things like cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness here too; [examples of these kind of statement here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QuF1M7k6VtBEtkHyQFvriQp1qi-aiKu1zrjB3pHoxB0/edit#heading=h.edug73oecu7z). These statements can then be used to form a test script (in conjunction with the kinds of scenario depicted in Job Stories), or to define whether a feature has been completed. 

Example:

For the first job story described in the previous section, acceptance tests would be:

* User can scroll through a list of countries on a landing page. Hovering over a country would highlight it. Clicking a country takes them to that page. 

* User can scroll through a number of indicator widgets, by default showing the latest data

* User can click a button to see the change since 2010 in each widget

* User can click a download button on each widget. This will trigger the download of a csv of the data for that widget. 

* User can find a citation for the data in a modal by clicking an information icon

* User can view the page on IE9

* User can view a non-interactive, responsive version of each widget when accessing through a mobile browser. 

Examples from our projects:

* [Trase](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRkIqmlZlTqIMq8cyX1fgAGmKvKqHzIw5nVOSyznwT0/edit)?

* [Climate Watch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ScvbpOhl0h0XB54KEdOtb_yX4nTJg9q6Y4YoIB27Slc/edit) (note the acceptance tests are still fairly high level)

* [Mozilla](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XaBjsa2DT1CTbxPb977mKPrxVYrTLc0uGXEH_BLBAKY/edit#heading=h.5d44p4h1pty4)

* [Resource Watch](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1amfWhi6vPewo9w5P6kNxDyL35Air0Br_Qyee9tjSO4A/edit#gid=0) (note these tests are much more specific + have a flow)

# **Measure the Impact of our projects**

Because we are in the early stages of impact measurement, this document is less of a helpful prescriptive guide and more a plan to make us better at measuring the impact of our work.

# Vision

Our purpose is of social change, to influence the behaviour of people through design and technology. We’d like to know how we’re doing on that. Our clients come to us because we can demonstrate the impacts our projects have. We can point to how many hectares of forest people have helped protect because they used GFW. We can point to the CSOs and NGOS that used the Goal 16 and GDA Dashboards to hold their governments to account. 

People also come to us because we put in the time and effort to research, experiment and innovate. Because we take impact monitoring so seriously.

# Introduction

At the moment we don’t really measure our impact. For an organisation that aims to make the world a better place, we don’t actually know if we are helping people live better lives or making a difference to the environment. 

All we have at the moment are analytics: XX users went to GFW last month, YY% are using this feature that *we think* will help them make decisions. We get some feedback every now and then, but that’s it. And this is obviously really useful for our internal processes, because it helps us work out if the technology we build actually works. But that’s just in the browser. 

We need a better way of identifying if the technology we build is generating the impacts we intend it to have. Then we will know if the features we build are actually useful, not just if they’re used/ usable. 

So how do we measure that? This document outlines a couple of methodologies for doing this and the financial/temporal implications of doing this. 

# How impact is traditionally evaluated

There’s a number of different tactics for evaluating the impact of a sustainable development project. The general measure of success is some kind of positive change in an indicator - more children survive to age 5, more girls get educated etc - against a baseline state, before the intervention. You might get randomised trials as well, with comparisons made to a baseline state and against a control group of some kind, but these are often costly and time-consuming to assess. The data can come from objective measures as well as end-of-project surveys. 

Within the UN/ NGO space the idea of SMART (NOTE:  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria ) objectives within a broad ‘theory of change’ are commonplace. An intervention is deemed effective if it reaches its intermediate goals, which in theory should lead to long-term impacts. 

# Our approach

## What do we want to measure?

* Have we increased knowledge?

* Have people taken actions?

* How effective were these actions?

* Using a sustainable development lens - economy, environment and society

* Problem - hard to attribute causality to our thing, especially as so many things change. SO need to look at individual level, marginal changes. "Could you live without it?"

## What will we do?

There are four groups of activities to bring about this strategy.  

### Project Setup

**Set goals in Discovery**. During our research we will be talking about product definition, who our users are, and how we want to achieve impact. As an additional output of our research, we should write out some target metrics that measure the success of the site itself (time on site etc) and whether it achieves the impacts we expect. Example metrics could include:

* % of time on site on key pages (map/ dashboard etc)

* Number of times data is downloaded

* Number of citations 

* # positive stories from users (I used it to do XYZ)

* # news articles about the tool

**Retirement strategies**. Every site has an objective: to achieve some goal like ending deforestation, making governments more transparent, etc. As well as writing success metrics in discovery, we should discuss how we would know we’ve solved the problem, so the site would no longer be needed. We call this a retirement strategy. 

### Reaching out to users

**Surveys.** This is a relatively low cost, but potentially high reward activity. The easiest way to do this is to install a Survey Monkey or Hotjar widget into the site, prompting users to complete a survey. We could also ask out clients to send out longer surveys, where they have a long list of potential users.

**Interviews/ tests.** Doing as we do already throughout our projects, but trying to see how people have already achieved impact with the tool. This could also double up as training/ onboarding for key stakeholders. 

**Observations and ethnographies**. In this activity we would go and visit our users where they are. We would watch people, learn from them, and see how we could improve their lives. We could also get them involved in the design process (if done at the beginning of a project) so we can co-create impactful solutions. 

### Talking with clients

**Retrospective after each project with client.** Around a month after a project has been launched, we should hold a retrospective with the client to analyse the feedback they’ve received so far and how it’s going. This would take the form of a classic retrospective, arranging feedback received into "what went well" and “what can be improved”. 

**Six month retrospective (big projects only). **We would also consider repeating this exercise six months after a project ends. This retrospective would take findings from analytics as well as comments received by the client, to assess who is using the tool, how, and if it’s been effective. 

**Extend the ‘embed phase’ with more tests and interviews.** Where we think it’s possible, we should extend the definition of the embed phase of our project proposals to include many more tests and interviews in the months after a product is launched, so we can see how people are using it in real life. 

**Funding M&E as a separate contract.** As part of the project follow-up tasks we could ask our clients if we could conduct monitoring and evaluation projects with them. During these M&E contracts we would aim to conduct some of the activities under ‘reaching out to users’, but with the specific objective of creating feature ideas that could be implemented under another implementation contract. 

### Communicating our findings

**Annual Impact reports****.** The idea here is to summarise our work in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals - how much good are we achieving across the world? The report would be simple (no more than 8 pages?) and cover a mix of analytics findings, user testimonials and client feedback. We could share the report internally and externally. 

**Invite clients to talk about our projects**. This activity is more internally focussed. As Toby Gardner did with Trase at the Christmas All Hands meeting last year, we would invite our client to make a quick presentation to the whole company about the project we’ve developed and the impact it’s having. 

**Lightning talks.** We should aim to hold one lightning talk every quarter describing our projects’ impacts. 

**Have an annual OKR about impact.** Another way to formalise this, and communicate our impact, is to have an OKR specifically mentioning the impacts we want to achieve in a year. We could select 5-6 high priority projects and what we want to achieve with each one. 

### Other ideas (not yet fully formed)

* Tech

* Recursion - we use the tech we build to monitor the impact. GFW shows that things are going down. 

* Emphasis on the developing world - test our assumptions about democratisation etc


We want our clients to feel happy working with us, and if possible they feel like working with us more, and to do that, we should know their measure their satisfaction. This section is about how we understand our clients feelings, if they feel we took care of them, reach their project needs, meet deadlines, the quality was the expected one and other things.

During the process of a project, we had a lot of conversations with our clients, we did reviews every once in a while, team meetings, follow-ups, put a bunch of to-do’s in Basecamp and so on. Hopefully, we will also run retrospectives when we finish the project that should be very valuable and give us the pulse of how the whole thing went on. But we want to go one step further, and we want to ask our clients more intimately, what they felt, not just our own hypothesis because we want to improve the way we work next time. Here we have certain tools that we might use to learn more on every project we run.

The first one of these tools is a form that we can customise depending on the project, we can use this one as a template where we ask direct questions that we want to answer. We should select who should be the best people involved in the project to answer this questions and define if we have to create different surveys depending on our different targets. 

[See the form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nujMzwg8SUu7c-mEi11Aje1exVg1iJ4CFUIWJ3vU42E/edit)

# **Sprint Guidelines**

# Sprints at Vizzuality

We run a lot of different kinds of sprint. Some are just a few hours, some are a few days. Each of them is a chance for us to get together, as a project team, to discuss the problems to be solved and start creating some solutions that fit the data, user and technology needs of the project. 

In these pages we outline some of the best practices we’ve learned from doing each of these. 

# When should I do a sprint? 

## Kicking off a project with a client.

Many of our sprints take place at the beginning of a project, but not necessarily at the beginning of every project. Ask yourself the following questions before deciding to invite the client for a sprint
- How big is this project? 
-- For relatively small projects, with quite tight and well-defined scope, a sprint is less necessary
- Is it a new project or client? 
-- If it’s a new project with a new strategic partner, definitely run a sprint
- Are they willing to come to Madrid? 
--Ideally they would bring a small team to our office: then it’s easier for us to bring in a wide range of staff as and when needed. 
--If not, think carefully about which staff to bring. Ideally we would bring a PM, research, design and dev/data. 

## Kicking off a project with our team.
Following that kick-off sprint, we then often hold a second internal sprint to push forward our thinking about website objectives, users, structure, architecture and features. To determine whether we need to do one, ask yourself:

- First read these guidelines about kicking off projects. 
-- Is your team informed enough about the project? Would they benefit from a 1-2 hour session discussing all the details of the project?
-- Have they had a chance to ask questions, and talk with each other about the different requirements?

- Identify an outcome 
-- if you did all meet for a few hours, what would you like to achieve? A first sketch of the wireframe? Clarity on feature requirements? A list of questions to ask back to the client?

-Identify who needs to be in the room to help achieve that.
-- Do you need the person that wrote the proposal, to help input client needs?
-- How many engineers should you bring (to make sure your ideas are technically feasible)? 
-- How large is the data component of the project? 

- Find a time and place, then write an agenda.

## Creating ideas for a new feature.
For our ongoing projects we are increasingly using sprints to better define new features and rapidly develop ideas to meet those needs. If any of the statements sound familiar to you, you may want to run a sprint. 

- The client is asking for a new feature but it’s not very well defined
- A client is asking us to “come up with something creative”
- The design team starts working on a feature but have a number of concerns about technical possibilities and data limitations

# Writing an agenda
If you do decide to run a sprint, look over the following pages for advice about the kinds of activities you could run, and how to put a sprint together. 

[Preparing a sprint](preparing-a-sprint.md) - Must Read before you go any further

**Remember to think about Remote People**. 
Identify which sessions (if they aren't coming to all) remote people need to call into.
Ahead of time, set up call-in information so they can contribute and make adequate room for it.

# **External Comms.**

We love talking about our work and hope you do too. We’ve prepared some advice for you if you want to know when and how to talk about our projects.

# Talking to the public. 

## Who are we and what do we do? 

Vizzuality is a mission-driven design and technology agency that creates bespoke, compelling data visualisations and digital tools that inspire learning, catalyse new decisions and improve our world. With a strong commitment to working in partnership with world-leading organisations, our experienced team of engineers, designers, data scientists and researchers has worked with the likes of The White House, NASA, the United Nations, the Stockholm Environment Institute, Google, and the World Resources Institute. Our work often bridges the gap between policy, science and citizens, helping people understand complex information and use it in their decision-making.

## Our persona. 

When we write and talk about ourselves as a company, we use a particular tone and style that reflects Vizzuality personality. [Our persona is called Andi](https://docs.google.com/a/vizzuality.com/document/d/1GM38FaggV94gHVbQYp9olxOotBgbg3FRJv3ni33DkgY/edit?usp=sharing). 

If you write or speak as ‘Vizzuality’ you should talk like Andi. 

If you are writing as yourself, express your personality in a way that reflects Vizzuality’s ethos. 

Want more writing advice? Contact Camellia.

## Project promotion.

When a project is live and the client is ready to promote it, we want to promote it too.

Typically, when a project goes public we:

* Publish a blog about the website/tool/app and explain what it’s for, why it’s different, and explain the issue it addresses. 

* Publish a blog about the technology or design techniques we used to build it. 

* Publish a project page for our website.

* Share links on social media to our blog and any articles written by the client or media. 

When a project is nearing launch please do the following:

* Tell Camellia about the project launch and what date it is going public on.

* Introduce Camellia to the client and say we’d like to help them promote the application that’s going public. 

## Responding to media enquiries. 

If you are approached by a journalist, tell Camellia. Even if the enquiry has nothing to do with Vizzuality, tell her. We are happy for you to talk to the media but keep us informed so we can help you answer questions about Vizzuality and share the article when it’s published. 

## Interviews.

We are happy for you to do interviews but please tell us if you are approached. Ask the person that’s asked for an interview to send you a link to it once it’s published. 

## Social media.

We love talking about what we do and we hope you do too. As soon as a client starts talking about our work publically, so can you. If you aren’t sure if you can tweet about something you are working on, ask the project PM for advice. We encourage you to share articles, advice or thoughts on the topics you are interested in. 

## Our social media channels.

**Twitter:** Follow us @Vizzuality and tag us when you talk about our work.

**Facebook:** Like our [page](https://www.facebook.com/vizzuality/) and share our posts with your friends.

**LinkedIn:** Follow our company page on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/434611/) and list the projects you work on in your profile. Add a link to the relevant Vizzuality [project page](http://vizzuality.com/) and add a short description about your role.  

## Conferences.

When you attended a conference, you are representing Vizzuality but be yourself and let your passions and interests shine. We don’t go to conferences to give boring powerpoint slides—we go to them to meet interesting people, make new contacts, and spark leads that lead to new work, collaborations and teammates. 

### Presentations.

When we talk at conferences, we want to inspire them and show them what’s possible when you combine data and design. We have a presentation template you should use to prepare your slides but if you need some design advice, talk to Sergio or Dani.

If you want to improve your presentation techniques, talk to Craig and he can share his tips on how to establish a relationship with an audience and get them laughing. 


# Project evaluation

All projects will be evaluated by Vizzuality and the client. These evaluations will be used to calculate a score to track project quality and client satisfaction, and we will share these scores openly.

## Objective

To find ways to improve how we work and inform the decisions we make by critically assessing our projects.

## Introduction

All projects will be evaluated using identical criteria. They will be scored on a numeric scale (1 to 5, where a lower value relates to undesirable attributes), and allowing for comments (using this spreadsheet). The guidelines below are provided to reduce ambiguity around particular criteria.

The evaluation is intended to fit within a project's life cycle, and integrate with existing practices at distinct phases of a project. However, to kick-start the process, we will short-circuit that for the first iteration and evaluate all ongoing projects at the same time.

## Criteria

### Timeliness

_“Were agreed milestones delivered on time?”_
   
**Who:** This evaluation should be performed by the Project Manager
   
**How:** Based on contracted / actual delivery date
   
**Question:** Have agreed deadlines been kept?
   
1 (Behind schedule) 3 (On time) 5 (Ahead of time)
   
**Other questions to consider:**
- Were the project milestones delivered on time?
- If the milestones were not accomplished: why?

**Frequency/When:**
- End of project. 
- At the time of major releases.

### Product quality

_“Would you show the project to your peers? (including the code)”_

**Who:** Team; PM + Technical Lead + Designer

**How:** Guided discussion during retrospective. The individuals involved in the project can score it individually, and return the average score.

**Question:** Did the product reach its expected quality? Would the team show it to their peers?

1 (Below expectations) 3 (Expected quality) 5 (Above expectations)

**Other questions to consider:**
- Did the final product reach its objectives?
- Did the project accumulate technical debt? 

**Frequency/When:** End of project

### Client satisfaction

**Who:** Client; (PM to send the evaluation)

**How:** Survey
**Question:** How likely is the client to recommend our services to a peer?

1 (Very Unlikely) →  5 (Very likely)

**Other questions to consider:**
- Communication: 
    - Was it clear who to contact in our team?
    - Were you happy with your interactions with our team members? 
    - Please rate the professionalism of our team with whom you interacted.  
- Support:
    - Did we reply to your queries and request in a timely manner? 
    - Did we give your issues enough attention? 
- Product:
    - Were you happy with the final product? 
    - Did we add value to the product beyond your expectations?
    - How likely are you to seek our services in the future? 
    - How likely are you to recommend our services to a peer?

**Frequency/When:** End of project. 

### BD value

**Who:** BD Team

**How:** Numerical data

**Question:** Does the project offer business development value?

1 (Low) →  5 (High)

**Other questions to consider:**
- What is the likelihood this project will lead more work with the current project team?
- What is the likelihood this project will lead to work with a different project team, and how big will the new project be?

**Frequency/When:** Quarterly across all projects

### Team value

_“How happy were you with the process?”_

**Who:** Team; PM + Technical Lead + Designer to seed the evaluation (initial phase); whole team eventually

**How:** Anonymous survey to be filled in before the retrospective, and to be discussed in the Retrospective. This survey can also be used to help guide the Retrospective discussion.

**Question:** What was the team’s experience of working on this project? How happy was the team with the process? Please explain why.

1 (Unhappy) → 5 (Very happy)

**Other questions to consider:**
- Was our experience working with the client positive?
- Were people given reasonable opportunity to learn and advance? (links to kick-off - pledges)
- Was the project technically relevant? 
- Were the project deadlines reasonable?
- Were project milestones and objectives clear?
- Did you receive sufficient support from your team and PM to do your job?
- Were you happy with the way the project was organized and executed?

**Frequency/When:** End of project.



# **Implementation Defaults**


# Motivation:

As part of our objectives around improving performance and client value in the next three months we will create user stories and acceptance tests associated with tasks and functionalities. [There’s a separate guide outlining our approach to that here.](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/stories-and-acceptance-tests/)

There’s a concern around the need to be comprehensive in such stories and tests, and about how to go about populating them (what things should be taken for granted unless stated otherwise, even if they are not specified in the user story/acceptance test)

The following list is not comprehensive and is subject to growth as we progress. The items are in no particular order:


## User Login
_Design, frontend, backend_

Whenever it is required for users to be able to log into a site they should also have the means to logout, cancel their registration and change their password.

If the user email is used for log in there should always be a confirmation sent to the user to verify they own the email and that it’s correct.

## Authentication required for pages
_Design, frontend, backend_
Whenever an unauthenticated user clicks to enter a page that requires authentication, the application should redirect to a login page (not overlay) and redirect back to the previous page after login.

## Storing user email
_Design, frontend, backend_
Whenever there’s a need to store user emails there should be a confirmation sent to the email. User’s should also have the means to change the email (in case they misspell it) and re-send the confirmation email. No other emails (subscriptions, newsletters, communications) should be sent to the user until they have confirmed their address

## Browser compatibility
_Design, frontend_
By default, and unless stated otherwise, all our projects should support the two latest versions of major desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Explorer/edge) and iOS/Android in mobile

## Device compatibility
_Design, frontend_
By default, and unless stated otherwise, all projects should be browsable in desktops, tablets and mobile phones. Specific functionalities may vary across them. Please ask if in doubt

## Error pages
_Design, frontend, backend_
All server error pages (404, 500, 502, etc) should be styled according to the site’s visual guidelines, and provide understandable information, plus a link to the site’s home and the previous page.

## Runtime errors
_Frontend_
Whenever there’s a runtime error in the application there should be a visual cue that tells the user that something went wrong.  Visual elements such as spinners, loaders or page overlays should stop to allow the user to navigate out of the page or retry.

## Image size optimization
_Frontend_
All images should be optimized for internet usage in size

## Crawler protection for unpublished sites
_Frontend_
All staging and unpublished sites should have a valid [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) to avoid crawlers indexing them until publication

## SEO defaults
_Frontend, backend_
All public sections of sites should contain the minimum set of SEO friendly tags [TBD]

#**Project Workflow.**

## Discovery.
BD & Researcher & PM & Designer: Go over project proposal to identify what’s requested. Define which steps of the workflow are needed.
Data Scientist & PM & Researcher: Go over the data to identify what’s requested and feasible. Discuss with the client to be sure we understood their data.
Researcher: Performs user surveys / interviews etc. Creates job stories.
Data Scientist & Designer: Discuss datasets to be visualised with client.
Researcher & PM & Designer & Data Scientist: Discuss job stories and data findings.

## Wireframes.
Designer & Researcher & PM (optional) & Tech Lead (optional)  & Data Scientist: Design sprint to start the wireframes.
PM & Researcher: Prioritise features, which ones are “Must have”, “Nice to have” and which ones can create future opportunities. 
Designer: Creates wireframes.
Designer & PM & Researcher & Tech Lead: Discuss wireframes and graphs (iterate if needed). Discuss potential tech stack and how it affects design.
Designer & PM: Present wireframes to the client; collect feedback, identify changes that are necessary. (iterate if needed)
PM & BD: Review scope of work and check if fits the proposal.

## Visuals.
Designer: Creates desktop and mobile visuals for several pages.
Designer & PM & Researcher & Tech Lead & Data Scientist: Discuss visuals (iterate if needed)
Designer & PM: Present visuals to client, collect feedback. (iterate if needed)

## Development.

Dev(s) & Designer: Development starts on the pages that are already designed. Designer continues with the rest of the pages.
Dev(s) & Designer & PM & Tech Lead & Data Scientist: Meet/share staging site for review and feedback.

## Ahead of Releases
Dev(s) & Researcher: Discuss analytics implementation (account setup, any custom events to track?), [read how to add analytics here](adding-google-analytics.md).
PM, Dev(s) & Camellia: Discuss interesting points from the project that could be put in a blog.

# **Kick-off Meeting & Project onboarding**

Making a proper project onboarding can be crucial many times; while some can see it as  just a "go" for others it can mean a “sink or swim” moment. In this document we’ll identify key needs and propose a solid structure for a successful project onboarding.

## What is project onboarding?

Usually this means the time in between we win a project and when we are ready to start, but this also applies to the time when a new fellow comes to the project. We’ll try to set a solid base during the general onboarding to facilitate newcomers to join.

## Previous steps

We need some time to review the initial proposal, preliminary emails and any kind of documentation. This step should be a PM responsibility in most cases with the participation of  the BD team, we should get the following outcomes:

* Project subject, a kind of short phrase that could describe the project.

* Project description, a more elaborated definition of what the project is about.

* Target users.

* Client description.

* Identify risks and caveats.

* Preliminary - user needs that this project should cover.

* Preliminary - project needs, what is this project demanding to gain success.

* Preliminary - client needs, what does the client expect from this project. 

* Preliminary - short term client needs, if there is a short term deliverable, how we could cover this without compromising quality or team rush.

* Preliminary - technical needs, identify tools and gaps. Think about company wide people that could help for consultancy.

* Preliminary - how we’ll add value to this project.

* Team allocation, who can work on this project. Who will be product owners in different areas.

* Setting up the tools, PT, Basecamp, Slack channel, GH and Intranet.

* Timeline or relevant milestones if any.

A document should be written with these points to help with the next step; where possible the intranet page should also be completed with this information.

## The kick-off meeting

In this event we’ll introduce the project to the whole team and we should get some outcomes. These are the points that should be covered in the meeting:

* Client introduction: Who is the client, previous projects if any. Anything to be aware of? 

* Project introduction: We should make a presentation, a slideshow is desirable. We’ll talk about motivations, targets, risks and caveats.

* Questions round.

* Discussion - user needs that this project should cover.

* Discussion - project needs, what is this project demanding to gain success.

* Discussion - client needs, what does the client expect from this project. 

* Discussion - short term client needs, if there is a short term deliverable, how we could cover this without compromising quality or team rush.

* Discussion - technical needs, identify tools and gaps. Think about company wide people that could help for consultancy.

* Discussion - how we’ll add value to this project.

* Discussion - what will we learn? Each team mate commit to learn at least one thing and will be revisit in the [retrospective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyvaJ8hzm_w7axakCi3d7qPTdVG2SiWUPKdEv8F8qfQ/edit).

* Discussion - should we ask for consultancy to someone else in the team?

* Roles and ownerships assignments. These roles will be also responsible of maintaining the documentation in their areas along the project.

* Giving access to the project tools to the team.

We’ll elaborate a document with the outcomes and link it into the Intranet. 

Next steps and follow-up

At this point we have enough information to set up a good client meeting kick off (This will be documented).

It’s of primary importance to keep up to date documentation for all the areas involved. This will help any newcomer to join the project. Every owner of the project is responsible of maintaining his/her documentation by using the right tools and linking that into the Intranet. Something like:

* Designers should put the link of the latest design and wireframes into the Intranet.

* Data scientists should put the link of the latest Jupyter notebooks into the Intranet.

* Social scientists or discovery owners should keep up to date their docs into the Intranet.

* Developers should write the links of all Github repos into the Intranet, as well as technologies and frameworks.

* Developers should document the Github repos properly, how to create the environment, how to deploy, dependencies and special procedures should be kept up to date.

* PM should document any important change or exception to the SOW and link it into the Intranet.

 

## We have a new buddie in the project

Someone is coming to the project. It’s time to have a meeting and talk about the project. The PM together with other project owners should meet, give a project description, explain technical solutions and ask for opinions to the newcomer. At this point, we should have up to date documentation enough to make a proper onboarding.

# Quality checklist
We want a minimum check to be applied to different aspects of the project to ensure that the end-product meet our high standards. We have identified several key criteria to check in four broad areas of a project's life cycle. 

## Research
There are a number of discovery activities included in the [main Project workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MGC8xPRhHqr7SbqFHh2k0Bmqo_4eyT2M3WzD8AjCBVg/edit), which are broken into smaller steps in the [long version of the Research Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AMAnbLkAFG0hIkJIIDID0oBchPIAPIeT1-Rq5x7SnTo/edit). In this document we outline the steps we need to take to ensure a quality delivery of each output. 
1. Consult the [list of research methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJet_b_4rORsQ5vxi3IDhCWHOVAFlKZpQboa7hKIJ_g/edit#) + project scope - which activities would be suitable? Could we try something new with this project?
2. Discuss scope of the output with the Project Manager, and set a goal for internal delivery. 
Define the boundaries of ‘quality’:  how many users do you need to interview from each user group to have a representative sample, how many survey respondents do you need, what is a representative time period for an analytics review? 
3. Follow the [Personas, Job Stories and Acceptance Test structure](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/stories-and-acceptance-tests/) where possible.
4. Share a first draft with Research team for comments.
5. Introduce the output to colleagues in a meeting (PM + design + data + lead engineer) and ask for feedback. 
6. Refine using their comments, and present to client. Again, hold a meeting to present your findings and gain feedback. 
7. Publish a final version on Basecamp and add a link in the Project Template.

### Other Tips
**Write in plain english.** Not all clients will know what a persona is etc. Make sure to present clearly what each output can be used for. Consider using Hemingway to test the readability of your work. 
**Give adequate time for review.** Notify colleagues ahead of time when to expect a draft. Once they have the document, give them enough time to read. 
**Keep reflecting on the research methods doc.** Every project is an opportunity to try a new approach, or refine our existing methodology. After each discovery period the team should reflect on what was achieved, and note down any improvements in that document. 


## Data
While individual projects and datasets may differ significantly, broadly speaking, where possible we should be attempting to ensure the following criteria are met:

1. Aim for open source and open access
Datasets are being held within projects in a way that makes them openly accessible and with licenses that enable their reuse.

2. Keep a clear chain of custody and metadata
We should aim to make the data provenance clear: i.e. document the point of origin, chain of custody and make clear any transformations or pipelines which have been applied to datasets that may have modified their contents. Datasets should also be described with metadata.

3. Encourage dataset reuse across projects
We should avoid siloing datasets and pipelines to individual projects. Datasets (and the knowledge of how to work with them) are resources, ideally we would want to use these resources again in the future. This is particularly important as we have many projects with overlapping spheres of interest. Where possible projects should encourage the use of datasets in a way that builds off of the usability and knowledge of datasets already used in the company, and in turn shares new datasets where possible. 

4. Ensure data transformations and pipelines clear and reproducible
We should at minimum be able to easily understand and replicate any modification to the original datasets, and produce any derivative data generated over the course of a project. Key practices that can ensure this include the use of technology like Docker and Jupyter notebooks.

5. Ensure we are delivering as much value as is reasonably possible
Often, the majority of time can be spent in the preparation and data engineering and bug fixing side of a project’s data tasks. We need to ensure that in addition to that we should make sufficient effort to deliver value beyond simply engineering the datasets into a minimally useable format - we should be aiming to deliver products that derive meaning and insights from raw data.


## Design
- [ ] The researcher reviewed the wireframes/design and gave them a green-light [  ]
- [ ] The developer reviewed the design deliverables before starting implementation
	- UI Kit, Icons (Icomoon), Compressed Images, Interactions...
- [ ] The designer reviewed the implementation and gave it a green-light
- [ ] The designer had big enough / uninterrupted chunks of time to focus on the project
	- Can we create a hard rule? 1 week 1 project?
	- Can development support / meetings happen in fixes hour of the day?
- [ ] Presentations included explanations
+ Add other project-specific quality checks when needed

# Project Phases
The phases of our projects are described in
[another document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MGC8xPRhHqr7SbqFHh2k0Bmqo_4eyT2M3WzD8AjCBVg/edit),
here we will talk about how to follow up on the different phases.


## Kick Off

Once a new project comes in, there are a number things that should happen straight away
- Create a project folder in dropbox and google drive + Slack channel. Invite core team to join it
- Open a new entry on the intranet explaining the project and linking to key docs
- setup a lightning talk to introduce the project to the whole team

Check that everyone has done the tasks assigned in the kick-off, and that any produced documents are made available to everyone.

## Discovery

Ensure that all the elements of discovery are discussed between the relevant
people as described in the
[workflow document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MGC8xPRhHqr7SbqFHh2k0Bmqo_4eyT2M3WzD8AjCBVg/edit#heading=h.quyk3gemme8s).
This is a key point where we
should be critical and see if we have gone beyond what was asked of us. We want
to build valuable projects and this depends on us challenging the premises and
coming up with creative and innovative solutions to solve the user needs.

In regards to the data discovery have we allowed time to identify things that
might be interesting and that the client wasn’t aware off? Is the data good
enough to do what we want to do? Are there any other datasets that we have
worked with in other projects that we could potentially use in the current one?
Are there points of contact with other ongoing projects?

## Data

Besides the interesting scientific questions related with data there are two
key questions that we need to ask straight away during the discovery and data
handling phase: Is all the data available?; Is the data in a state that we can
work with?. If the answer to either of these questions is no, we will need to
bring it up with the client and discuss the timeline with them; these need to
be made available and be in a good state to start designing.

To keep track of data in each project it is recommended that we have an
inventory spreadsheet where the different datasets are listed and any relevant
metadata is captured (e.g.: state of the dataset; where can it be found; what
type of data it is; source; etc.). This document needs to be kept up to date
during the life of the project, so that we can always refer to it as necessary.

When there is the need to process the client’s data to use in the project any
scripts and instructions on how to run them and how to use the generated data
should be documented on a repository on Github. Typically this has been done
through the use of Jupyter notebooks, and our data scientists are quite
familiar with this. These notebooks can then be shared with the development
team to explain how to use the data, and regular communication between the
data team and the developers will ensure that all is clear and the project can
move forward.

As with the other areas of a project, a timeline should be defined for the
data processing part. This should be aligned with both the design and
development phases, so that both phases can be informed as needed.

## Design

At each review point of the design process there are a few things that are
important to check with different members of the team (research, development,
data):

- Do the designs meet the requirements for each page?
- Are the designs too complex for implementation? Are there simpler alternatives?
- Will the designs have a strong impact in performance of the application? Will we need to request a lot of data on specific pages?
- Are all the interactions thought through (e.g.: how will a set of filters work; what happens when you click a dropdown; etc.)
- Are we accounting for the different states of the application (e.g.: errors in a form; no data; too much data; very few data; etc.)?
- Are we innovating? Are we going beyond the standard approaches? Are we keeping a balance?

Some of the points above don’t have straight forward answers and might require
allowing more time for the design process, but it is important that they are
discussed so that the conditions are met for us to deliver a good
product.

## Development

### Development Kick-off

Ahead of development we should run a development kick-off meeting where we
review all the pages that will be implemented and discuss how to split them
into releases. Release planning needs to take into consideration the client’s
priorities, and the releases might need to be reviewed as the project goes on,
to make sure that we keep aligned with those priorities. During the release
planning there might be new questions appearing about the designs. These
should not be ignored as the designs are not really set in stone, and if there
are doubts or ways to improve them we should do it.

### Sprints

Having decided on the release schedule, the next organizing unit is the
sprint. Knowing what needs to be delivered next should allow the development
team to organize the work in one or two weeks sprints. This allows us to
deliver updates to the client and to keep them in the loop about what we are
doing, and also enable the review of priorities with each new delivery.

### Daily Meeting

It’s recommended that the project team holds a daily meeting where they can
report what they’ve worked on and will be working on that day. This meeting
can be very valuable as it makes it possible to identify blockers, and
opportunities to share experience and to organize pairing sessions when
relevant. Having designers and data scientists on this meeting is also
recommended as this way interactions can be scheduled replacing ad-hoc
interruptions. The daily meeting is also a good place to update estimates of
ongoing tasks, which will help plan the next
sprints.

# Timeline

Each project should be tracked on the project’s timeline document with
information about its deliverables and key milestones. When a task is
delegated to a member of the team, they also inherit the responsibility to
keep the timeline up to date for their task. The timeline must be kept up to
date by either the project manager or project leads.

It is advised that this document be shared with the whole team so that
everyone knows what to expect on each project. Besides including it on the
intranet page this document can be shared on the team channel on Slack and
pinned so that it’s easy to find.

# Tools

## Basecamp

We use it to communicate with our clients' teams. Basecamp is where most of
our conceptual discussions take place and where high level tasks are maintained.

### Tips and Best practices

- When using basecamp you can tweak the list of who will receive email
notifications for your messages.It's a good practice to pick the correct list
of recipients, rather than sending a message to everyone on the project, so
that people aren't flooded by all messages.
- When ToDo lists are being used in a Basecamp project it's important to use
the assignment functionality. This should be set to the person you're
expecting an answer from and a rough deadline for when you’re expecting an
answer, so that conversations don't get lost without response.
- It is your responsibility to keep an eye on tasks assigned to you and to
answer to discussions when you are mentioned on them. So make sure to tweak
Basecamp's settings so that they suit your way of working. If you like emails,
get emails, if you don't, visit the website.
- If you are assigned to new tasks or brought in to some discussion but you are
busy with other more urgent tasks, it is a good practice to acknowledge the
assignment or message anyway, so that no one is left hanging. [e.g.: Thanks
for your message, I'm currently in the middle of something, but will look back
at this as soon as I can].
- If you feel that a task or message is better suited to be dealt with by
someone else make sure to assign them or let them know, as they might not have
been notified.

## Pivotal Tracker

Our default tool to manage internal tasks for each of our projects. The UI and
functionality might be overwhelming, but if we all use it the same way then we
should minimise confusion and increase usefulness.

One key thing to keep in mind is that this is an internal tool, we are the
ones driving it and so it's our responsibility to ensure that it is useful for
us. However many of our boards are ‘public’ so make sure you consider an
external audience when writing tasks or comments.

### Pivotal Tracker stages in real life

|      STATE    |  REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTERING STATE |  REAL LIFE ACTIONS |
| ------------- |--------------------------------| ------------------|
| STARTED       | The task has been assigned to you or you have picked it from top of priority list and you are now available to start working on it. You understand what needs to be done and you have all the data / assets / copy required to complete the task. If there are missing resources that you need, don’t forget to notify the relevant person (it might be a data scientist, a designer, or a developer). | You created a new branch. |
| FINISHED      | You have completed the task and it is now ready for review, which means you have written the code, tested the code, written automated tests, seen the automated test build pass, run a codestyle check and fixed any violations before passing it on to a reviewer. | You have created a pull request, written a description of what this is for and how to test this, waited for any automated build tools to pass and assigned 2 reviewers (please refer to code review guide). Please ensure the PR contains the minimum set of changes needed to satisfy the requirements of the PT task, keep it small. |
| DELIVERED     | The reviewer has checked the code for smells, inconsistencies, violations of project-wide conventions as well as tested the code. Testing the code is not required in case of a reviewer who is not on the project team. | The reviewer approved the pull request (please refer to code review guide). |
|               | Code is merged into the integration branch. | 2 scenarios for this: <ol><li>as the code author you merge the code. It is your responsibility to resolve any conflicts, wait for automated builds to pass on the integration branch & resolve any unexpected issues.</li><li>the reviewer merges the code. This is a quicker flow which does not require a round-trip to the author, and is probably more appropriate for small changes on non-conflicted branches with small potential for regressions.</li></ol> |
|               | Task is ready to test in a non-local environment. Most typically this will be a staging environment. | An automated deploy hook is recommended for deploys from integration branch (develop -> staging). If the automated deploy is not enabled, whoever merged the code should deploy it and verify it is actually ready for testing on the dedicated environment. |
| ACCEPTED      | Task has been verified to work in the testing environment and meet acceptance criteria. Acceptance can be done on the Retrospective/Planning meeting or when the Project Manager reviews the status of Pivotal Tracker | Once all tasks in a release have been accepted, changes from the integration branch can be merged into the production branch. It helps to keep releases small. Here's a useful [branching workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). |

For designers, data folks and others the Pull Request might not be the
delivery system, but Pivotal Tracker can still be used.

### Planning sprints

The best way to ensure that Pivotal Tracker is up to date is to ensure that
everyone is using it and that it reflects the state of the project.

It is recommended that each project team meets at least once a week to plan
their project sprints. Recommended agenda for such a meeting is:

- Retrospective on previous sprint [if no specific meeting for it], goal is to
check where the project is and if there were any issues;
- Discussion of priorities, the Project Manager should make sure to
communicate any priorities discussed with the client;
- Identification of tasks to work on the new sprint;
- Ensure that all tasks have been estimated;
- Create a release on Pivotal Tracker with the date of the end of the sprint
and describe the goals of the sprint on the description.

After the planning meeting everyone should know what they are working on and
what are the goals for the sprint.

### Tips and Best practices

- Stories and epics have more than a title, you should make sure to read their
descriptions when picking up new tasks, to make sure you know as much as
possible when starting to work on something;
- You can click in your name or in My Work to get a list of the things that
are assigned to you;
- If you find something that needs doing and you can't find an associated
story on Pivotal Tracker, make sure to add it and to explain why it is needed
the best you can;
- Tags help organize work and can be useful to decide on what to work next, if
you're adding new stories make sure to tag them consistently;
- Sprint planning is a team job, everyone should be involved and participate
actively in it; that is the only way that an accurate list of tasks can be set
for a given sprint;
- Don't forget to update your stories when you finish some stage;
- When creating a Pull Request you can add a link to a Pivotal Tracker story
to make it easier for the reviewers to understand what they are reviewing;
- Most of our Pivotal Tracker projects are connected to a channel on Slack, if
you add your Pivotal Tracker handle to your notification list on Slack you
will never miss a relevant message;

### Epics, stories, backlog, icebox, and points

We all know that Pivotal Tracker is a bit complex, below is information on how
the key components could be used successfully.

#### Epics

These are the highest level units on Pivotal Tracker. Epics work well to
organize smaller tasks in terms of a User Story (high level functionality that
the application should support) or a specific website page (when separation in
pages makes sense).

The best way to make use of Epics is to add them at the start of a project and
then use them to tag specific stories. This will allow everyone in the project
to have a sense of what's left to do in regards to each user story.

The Epic's description can hold the full user story or a link to a document
that clearly describes the epic for further information.

#### Stories

Each story represents a feature on the application. Each story should be
clearly labelled with the epic that it's related with and any other tags that
make sense. Stories should also be estimated and if a story doesn't fit in the
points range being used, it should probably be split into smaller tasks.

For further clarity make sure to use the story description to add any detail
or advice that might be relevant. If there are clear sub-tasks on a story you
can also use them to better communicate what's happening with it.

#### Backlog

Usage varies but it seems to work well if we keep only the stories that we are
aiming to tackle in a given sprint, this way there's less clutter and it's
easier to check the pulse of a sprint.

#### Icebox

Here we keep the tasks that are not part of the current sprint but that should
be considered next. It's recommended that the icebox be filled as soon as
there's information about specific user stories, so that there's a pool of
stories to work from.

#### Points

It's recommended to use points as number of hours. A custom range can be set,
and at team Rosling we have been using 0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,14,16. Points
should be set by the team on each sprint planning or after any estimation
effort; they will help define each sprint.

# Warnings

## Avoid spreadsheets and other information sinks

One of the major threats when running a project is that information gets
spread across different tools and not in a central location. Often times
clients will provide a spreadsheet or send a document or information via
email. It is important to avoid using those documents as the information
source as not everyone will have access to them or they will be hard to
maintain. If the client sends one document like that and you can’t convince
them to use Basecamp or Pivotal Tracker (in the cases where clients are also
using Pivotal), you should still add the tasks to the right task management
software yourself. This requires some extra leg work of keeping things in sync
but will benefit the whole team, as everyone will know where to check what’s
happening in the project and what feedback has been
received.

## Avoid private conversations on important project topics

It is normal to have private or even offline conversations about different
aspects of a project be it at high level or more task level. This is normal,
but it is important that all key decisions or comments that benefit everyone
involved in the project be communicated on the project channel. So if you are
having such a conversation assess if it should just happen in the channel for
everyone involved to be able to benefit and contribute to it, and if you still
go ahead and have it in private make sure to communicate back to the channel
the outcomes of said meeting/conversation.

## Assess the impact of client dependencies on our work

One risk of working so closely with our clients is that we depend not only on
their feedback but also on them providing datasets and style guides or other
materials. We should be careful to always define deadlines for the client to
provide us anything that we need from them, and when to decide on what to do
if a deadline is missed. One option is to shift focus to other parts of the
project that are not dependent on their immediate input, but it should also be
considered the possibility of halting development until the input is received.
This should be clearly communicated to the client early on, so that this risk
is well understood.


# **Introductions to participants**
Go round the table and ask everyone to introduce themselves, their role on the project and EITHER a random fact about them that no-one else knows OR how they feel right now
**Time needed:** 10 minutes

# Introducing the sprint
After introducing everyone, you should introduce the objectives of the sprint: why are you all meeting here, what are you trying to achieve? Give an overview of the agenda - what are the key sessions, what should participants be trying to achieve in each session, and how will that help us reach our goal? Explain the ideation diamond (shown below) and the idea that we start by diverging (thinking creatively and widely) and then slowly converging back towards 1 or 2 core ideas. 

You should also read out these ‘ground rules’ at the beginning of the workshop too, to set out how we want to behave during the sprint. 
- Respect the clock - we have a lot to get through, so let’s try to stay on time. This also means listen more, speak less: let everyone have an equal opportunity to say something.
- Respect the speaker - no side conversations, no idea is a bad idea, and ask positive questions to drive the conversation forward. 
- Respect the group - the unit of delivery is the team. We’ll succeed by working together, and everyone doing their bit. 
- Active note-taking is essential. We’ll open a google doc for written notes, and every session should start with a nominated scribe. For visual activities we’ll open a google drive folder to upload photos to: please give them a name (session number + what’s in the picture). Everyone gets a pen and paper at the beginning too - be visual if it helps you think through your ideas. 
- You are not the user. When we’re asking for opinions and reviews, we’d ask that you consider the key user personas for the project. How are we giving them value? Why will they come to the site? 
- When you do speak, think carefully about your tone. We’re at the very start of this process: no idea is ruled out yet. In order to help bring out all the possibilities and build on them, we ask you to adopt the attitude of “Yes and”. This is a trick from improvisation, where a team builds out an idea for a sketch through positive enhancement. If you feel yourself saying “no” or “but”, think about how you can rephrase your idea to be additive and drive the conversation forward. 
- Also try not to use ‘killing sentences’ that immediately discard an idea. Things like “that has been done before” and “that’s not going to work” are not too useful; think about how it was done before or why it didn’t work before, and use that to make this idea better. 

**Time needed:** 15 minutes

# Information Download/ Lightning talks
We also usually start our sprints with a series of contextual presentations to give context about the project, the users and any lessons learned from previous work. In the past we’ve had talks on the following
- Client PM - project objectives, what’s the problem to solve
- Client - lessons from a previous phase of the project
- Client - explain the data/ content to be visualised
- Researcher or Client - who are the users?
- Tech lead - what are the opportunities we could use (e.g. VR)/ are there any constraints we should bear in mind?
- Designer/ clinet - what are the design references we may follow
- Client PM’s boss (the strategy person) - what impact are we trying to achieve?

Run Q&A at the end, once all the talks are heard, not between each one. 

**Time needed:** 5 mins per talk + 5 mins Q&A per talk

# User journeys

## Useful for. 
Working out the steps users need to take, from getting to your site through to achieving their goal. Finding the pain points (to avoid) and the moments of happiness and joy that will make them want to keep exploring/ come back. 

## How to do it. 
Start at the user’s goal. What do they want to achieve? Put this out on the far right of a whiteboard. Now put the user on the far left, and start talking through their journey. How do they know about the site, how do they get there, how do they get through the site? And what are they thinking as they go through the site? 

**A good example.** None yet
**Time needed.** ? Perhaps 20 minutes for each persona, do 3, so an hour. 

# Landscape Analysis

## Useful for. 
Seeing what a client thinks is a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ website. Comparing our offering to other sites, in order to find our competitive advantage

## How to do it. 
Start by asking a simple question: “show me a few websites that are very similar to the site you want to build in this project”. This should show you their competitors. Then break the site we’re building into small pieces of functionality, and ask “show me a site you use that does this well”. Examples could include “show me sites that have checklists” or ‘show me sites with a good map”. All the time keep asking “what do you like about this”, “what can we learn from this”, “what can we improve on”.

**A good example.** PSA [activity description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_7hgCwA2M679u4fD9BtXgUEDmY28Ep8FLBgCIGwYZ4/edit#heading=h.yco98k6v8pge) and [outcome](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnfFvdkdGdEdN1tvgJlHCHJ7KaKMjTYi_LjCt4U0wKI/edit#heading=h.a58hecoopkaw)

**Time needed.** Around 15-20 minutes

# What have you learned so far?

## Useful for. 
Projects that have been going on for a while. Projects where we’re rebuilding something/ building on top of an existing prototype/

## How to do it. 
This is more of an open session, a chance to understand what they have and have not tried yet. Make sure to write out a list of all the questions you want to ask the client, then just ask them in a Q&A format. 

**A good example.** Public Safety Assessment. [See the list of questions we put together here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_7hgCwA2M679u4fD9BtXgUEDmY28Ep8FLBgCIGwYZ4/edit#heading=h.3dy6vkm)

**Time needed.** Keep it to around 15 minutes and no more. 

## Organising a Brown Bag Talk 
This guideline shows the steps to follow after you have decided to organise a brown bag talk (i.e. it does not cover the steps to decide if you should give a brown bag talk).
As the organiser of a brown bag talk there are a few steps to follow to make sure it goes as you expect. 
### 1. Scheduling the brown bag talk
It is up to you for how long you want to schedule the brown bag talk. 
If you want to make sure certain people are available on the time slot you have in mind use the Google Calendar web app to see these people availability (they might be out of the office or in a full day workshop or it might be a bank holiday in one of the offices). 
### 2. Sending the invites out
Once you have decided on the time slot, use your calendar to send the invites to all. 
### 3. Booking the meeting room in Madrid (optional)
Even if you will be presenting remotely, you might wish to use the material from the meeting room in Madrid (TV and Owl). If so, follow the guidelines to book the meeting room.
If you are not in Madrid, delegate on someone (and let them know) to set up the material on time. 
### 4. Getting food for the Madrid office (optional)
If you have chosen to schedule the talk during the 2-3pm slot, as the organiser, it is your responsibility to decide if you will request food. Inform on your decision to order food for the brown bag talk the previous day in the #madrizz channel. Three hours before to the start of the brown bag talk inform Liuba or Laura of the number of people that will be attending to then order food. 


#  How to book a meeting room in Madrid

This guideline covers the protocol to book any of the meeting rooms in the Madrid office:
- Meeting room (Madrid)
- Meeting room (Forest)

## Material available

### Meeting room (Madrid)
- TV set (HDMI cable with thunderbolt adaptor) 
- Meeting Owl (USB 3 connection)

### Meeting room (Forest)
- Jabbra microphone (Bluetooth and USB3)
- Logitech camera (USB3)

Each meeting room has a Google calendar that anyone at Vizzuality can read and edit. 
## Subscribe to the Google Calendars
These steps to subscribe to a calendar via the Google Calendar web should only be done the first time: 

 1. on the left panel next to `Other calendars` click on the `+` sign
 2. select `Subscribe to calendar`
 3. search for `meeting`

Repeat to subscribe to both calendars. 

## Book a meeting room
Via the Google Calendar web check the availability of the meeting rooms by enabling their calendars. Drag in the calendar the desired slot. In the pop up select the calendar of the room of interest. From here it is also possible to invite all the people involved in the meeting. It is also possible to create the event in your own calendar and invite the Meeting Room of choice. Either way, it is important to double check the correct meeting room has been booked. 

## Change meeting room or cancel booking
Via the Google Calendar web edit the event and change the calendar it belongs to. The change can be to the other meeting room (make sure you check the availability) or to your own calendar (this will cancel the booking). 

## Booking conflict
If when checking the calendar to book there is no availability, check who is the organiser and drop them a line. 

# Building a stakeholder network map

## Useful for. 
Helping a client understand who are the most important or influential people in their network. If they’re not sure who they should be targeting/ have too many target personas, use this to refine their thinking. The objective is to clarify who is most important for us to think about, who influences them (and how), and if there are other processes/ concerns that may be influencing our core users to the extent where our site may be ineffective. Knowing this early means we can mitigate barriers and use opportunities to achieve impact. 

## How to do it. 
Gather around a bit whiteboard/ piece of paper. Start by writing out all your main personas on postits, and creating a kind of network tree to show responsibilities, lines of communication and how certain people influence others. From this discussion you should arrive at 1-3 priority users who hold the most power to change the system. 

Then next to that diagram, draw three concentric circles. Your innermost circle is the ‘core user’, the second are ‘influencers’ and the outermost circle is ‘drivers’. Put all the core users in the innermost circle, the people who influence them directly in the 2nd circle, and others with less influence (or who influence the 2nd ring) in the outermost circle. Start drawing lines to connect these people. Then go through again and add other things (organisations, processes, non-human actors) that influence people’s behaviour in this network.

**A good example.** [Forest Watcher](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9iu7Qcff3aBNHJ3VXBoTmZqaWs/view?usp=sharing) or PSA: [description of activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_7hgCwA2M679u4fD9BtXgUEDmY28Ep8FLBgCIGwYZ4/edit#heading=h.is84is9cnzlh) and [outcome](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnfFvdkdGdEdN1tvgJlHCHJ7KaKMjTYi_LjCt4U0wKI/edit#heading=h.hukv0sc8l0or) 

**Time needed.** Around 30 minutes

# Formal Review Process

## Overview 

We have made a lot of progress towards addressing how ongoing feedback will be implemented at Vizzuality, but we are yet to elucidate how formal reviews will be carried out, mainly in the context performance reviews.

Note that here we will use the terms *formal review / performance review* interchangeably to refer to any review process used in appraisal situations (i.e. negotiating a pay-rise).

***

## Defining Summative Feedback

First, it is useful to define formative (*ongoing*) and summative (*end of line*) feedback more clearly.

What is the distinction? If we can identify the differences, we can identify elements that we can take from the formative system and what elements need to be altered.

Here, formal reviews are a summative mode of feedback whose goal is to collect evidence in order to assess progress or competence. Typically, summative feedback is characterised by being:

- *Linear*

  i.e. not a feedback *loop* (at least not in the short-term)

- *Long term*
  
- *Retrospective*

  Whereas ongoing feedback should be timely, giving advice as soon as possible, fomrative tends to collect evidence over a longer period of time in order to make some kind of assesment

- *Assessment Tool*
  
  i.e. measured against some competencies. Remember that competencies can have vertical bands (objective, binary skill checks: “I can do X, Y, Z”) and horizontal gradients (subjective, analogue: “I can do X well, without difficulty, etc”)

- *Identifying Future Objectives*
  
  Should be used to formulate long term goals that would take significant time to achieve.
  
***

## Relation to Core Competencies

See Vizz [core comps document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ng6H8mzKMt98nUkeJofLgemHIoW2o2xPqZKaKq1Tz1Q/edit).

We need to make this as objective as possible (*verticality*) and introduce some kind of proficiency scale (*horizonatality*), condence, and convert into a simple grid.

Verticality describes a binary checklist of skills that some employee can demonstrate in their particular role:

> *i.e.* "*I can do x, y, z*"

For example: 

> "*I can add/update endpoints on the api*"

These should be objective skills that any employee either can or can't do, and be related to thier role.

Horizontality (*I swear this is a word*) describes a sliding scale of ability in any particular skill.

> *i.e.* *"I can do x well, need to improve y, and z extremely well"*

The latter could use ongoing feedback as evidence for progression along any skills horizontal axis.

***

## *How could this be implemented?*

*Coming soon!*

# Paid Journey Days

Travel has a considerable environmental impact on nature and our health. The transport sector on its own accounts for **a quarter of all the European Union's greenhouse gas emissions**. By 2030, the EU pledged to reduce its emissions by at least 40% compared to 1990. It is urgent to act if we are to mitigate the ecological crisis.

Lower carbon-intensive modes of transportation exist but they also come with two main challenges: **price** and **duration**. For some, the **price can be mitigated** but **duration is not something that can be acted upon at an individual level**.

For these reasons, Vizzuality incentivises the switch to more sustainable modes of transportation in the form of **Paid Journey Days**.

## Goals

- Support and encourage employees to travel more sustainably
- Promote experience and knowledge sharing on sustainable travel within Vizzuality
- Carry out Vizzuality’s purpose and values to the way we operate

## Guideline and conditions

With Paid Journey Days, employees are **rewarded with extra paid vacations when taking more sustainable modes of transportation** to go to and come back from their holiday destination.

During **2022** (from January 1st 2022 to January 31st 2023), each employee is entitled to **two extra paid holidays**. These are attributed conditionally and the employee must be able to justify that:

1. They are travelling to or back from their holiday destination by either **train, bus/coach, or ferry/boat** (cruise ships excluded);
2. For each of the requested Paid Journey Day, they:
    - **travel for at least four hours** during that day or;
    - arrive back home after **having travelled during a substantial part of the night**;
3. They **don't use the Paid Journey Days to travel to or back from an airport** with the intention of travelling by plane.

Employees that wish to use their Paid Journey Days will use the **regular holiday approval mechanism** to confirm beforehand that their holidays don’t conflict with project schedules or don’t cause capacity shortages. On Bamboo, they will ask for the Paid Journey Days as “Unavailable” days with a note that mentions them, and the rest as “Vacation”.

In addition, employees that use their Paid Journey Days will be **asked to share their travel plans beforehand in the _#sustainable-travel_ Slack channel using the predefined workflow**. The goal is to inspire others to spend theirs and to create accountability for their use.

Vizzuality will not ask for the tickets or receipts of the travels. The **system is based on trust** and **will be re-evaluated at the end of 2022** to eventually extend it further in time. If people start to use the initiative in other ways than the ones described in this guideline, it is likely it won’t be renewed.

# Creating Personas

## Useful for.
Learning about who the key users are, their needs and their capacities/ skills. Getting a whole team to empathise with who we’re building for. 

## How to do it. 
First identify 2-4 key user personas, ideally ahead of the workshop. Split the group into 2-4 smaller groups, making sure there’s a good mix of Vizzuality vs client in each small group. Each group takes one persona and fills in a template. [We have a template here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cl2HOUn25boeAYiy4IUBcdOhfHj6WNdD1f5MxqXJA74/edit) Vizz staff should help the client talk about the people they know who fit that persona, and keep questioning their statements to get richer information. 

**A good example.** [Mozilla workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBQ3FSNlk0dTNfNVk) or Empathy Maps at PSA workshop. See [description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_7hgCwA2M679u4fD9BtXgUEDmY28Ep8FLBgCIGwYZ4/edit#heading=h.is84is9cnzlh) and [outcomes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1fmref94Gk908sUqNTAaOQ4cNHDKp6L7J)

**Time needed.** 50 minutes. 5 minutes to set up the activity, 15 minutes split into three groups, then 3 x 10 minute presentations of the personas. 

# **Preparing a sprint**

Once you’ve decided it’s the right time to do a sprint, there are a few things you should do to get everything set up for a productive and creative meeting. 

## Set outcomes and outputs
The first thing to do is write out exactly what you want to achieve by doing the sprint. What are you going to deliver out of it, what are you going to learn by working together that you wouldn’t have otherwise learned?

## Write an agenda
Use the suggested activities in the index and select the right activities for your sprint. We recommend running a sprint for no longer than 6 hours in a day, and splitting up the day into 3 x 2 hour chunks (or 4 x 90 min). At the end of each section leave 20-30 minutes for coffee, food, emails and to stretch legs. You want to keep people awake and alert - keeping them in a room for too long is counter productive. 
It’s a good idea to think through the materials you’ll need for each session, any pre-requisites that will be needed (knowledge, homework etc) and how notes will be taken.

[You can use this spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1MDw17maxty55JsvIUdNAx0-hIiJAZXHJTd1m-3sFU/edit#gid=0) to help you plan out an agenda. 

## Set homework
It’s always good to come to a sprint well prepared. We suggest you:
- Brief the client so they are able to present key elements of the project and what they’ve learned so far during the project
- Make sure the whole team has read the proposal, understands the project, and has answered any concerns they have
- If possible, do some preliminary user discovery so you can present user personas and user needs

## Thinking about remote peers
We’re a remote company. While it’s often best to all meet face-to-face, it’s not always possible (especially if short notice, family arrangements or other things). There’s a number of things you can do to make sure remote participants are able to contribute effectively
- Get there 15 minutes early to prep the room - microphone/ speakers are set up, webcam is working, tv is working so we can see them. 
- Make sure someone is taking live notes - if the sound cuts out, or they need to step out for a bit, this makes it easy for them to come back in
- Use a Slack channel or Google Drive folder to take images regularly (especially where sketching tasks are involved)

It’s your job as a facilitator to make sure they can follow/ join the conversation. There’s a few tips you can use to do this well. 
- When you open a topic for discussion, start by asking the opinion of remote people - this stops the people in the room jumping on the topic and potentially excluding the remote joiners. 
- If they’ve been quiet for a while, direct questions to them (“what do you think”)
- For larger gatherings: make sure that, when questions are asked, the questioner is near a microphone. You can use chats in Slack or Hangouts to repeat questions. 
- Try using a flag system - especially where lots of people are remote, allow people to ‘raise their hand to speak’, and make sure the people in the room do the same when they want to talk.

OK, now you're ready to start putting toegether an agenda! [Go back](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/sprint-guidelines/) 

# What problems do we need to solve in this sprint?

## Useful for.
Putting all the team’s worries, concerns and unknowns together in one place, grouping them into key areas to discuss, and prioritising things to put in the agenda. This works best 

## How to do it.
Everyone gets some post-its, and 5 minutes to write out some of their questions. After 5 minutes we’ll start adding the questions. As we add postits, we will start to group them based on themes that emerge. At the end of the session we run a voting exercise - what are the top topics we need to cover? Which ones can wait? 

**A good example.** [Mozilla](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBeDQxVDFLaXUtVVU)

**Time needed:** 40 minutes (2 minutes setup, 5 minutes thinking, 18 minutes presenting, 15 minutes grouping and prioritising).

## Professional Guidance

_The purpose of this guideline is to make sure there is a way for Vizzuality people to receive support (guidance) in their professional growth._

## Contents

- [Principles](#principles) 
- [How it will work](#how-it-will-work)
- [Working with the existing feedback review process](#working-with-the-existing-feedback-review-process)
- [Other details](#other-details)
- [How objectives and results work and could be written](#how-objectives-and-results-work-and-could-be-written)
- [Checklist for your Objectives and Results](#checklist-for-your-objectives-and-results)




How does it work? It’s pretty simple. Choose a guide, then every 3 months have a conversation to define and review your objectives and results. This is an opportunity to celebrate what you’ve achieved and also think carefully about what comes next. Repeat forever.

### Principles
- It is driven by you, not a boss. A guide supports you rather than tells you what to do.
- It should be regular and consistent.
- This doesn’t replace regular daily/weekly/monthly feedback from your team.
- Everyone in the company choose their guide.
- We will predefine a pool of volunteer guides
- This isn’t a process to review performance or define salaries/bonuses; rather it’s about supporting professional growth.
- In one year we will review if it’s working. If it’s not we can revise it or completely change, but everyone must at least try it out for a year.

### How it will work
1. Identify a guide to help with your objectives (typically someone with more experience and someone schooled in being a guide) and publish who it is in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1urS7K81ZPrThY9foclGUa5XxMKGhu7E2AcwX1x1TkGQ/edit#gid=966584708)
2. Set quarterly/biannual objectives and results yourself and review with the guide. Making sure they are results driven, measurable etc. see below for details in how to write objectives.
3. Once objectives and results have been set, publish publicly by default unless there is a strong reason not to.
4. After each quarter,
	* On your own, score each result 0-1 then
	* Arrange a meeting with your guide.
	* During the meeting discuss what went well, what didn't, what was missed and why.
	* Go away and create new/adjust results and objectives for the next quarter
	* Arrange another 30 mins meeting with guide
	* In meeting, check results and obj, checking they are good and can be measured in 3 months time. Also check how realistic they are and if others need to be involved. Also use checklist below to help.
	* Publish and Repeat
	* Regularly have one-to-ones with your guide and/or peers.


### Working with the existing feedback review process
This is tbd pending a new feedback process. This section will be updated once that is agreed. In the interim:

If you have a working review process in place, carry on until the new feedback guidelines are complete. There is one important part that will change. **Objectives (sometimes known as goals in the review process) should only be written and shared as part of the guidance process.** This is to avoid confusion and duplication of work. Of course you can use what you have learnt in the feedback review to help inform your objectives for the guidance.

If you are happy to use the guidance process in place of the review process, that is okay too. If you do that, it is advised 
you make sure the reviews are not forgotten and the knowledge in your current reviewers are not ignored. Therefore, for the first round of guidance meetings, it is recommended that your previous reviewers are there too. After the first meeting, the current reviewer will step back and your guide will continue. In some cases it might actually be the same person, in which case the main difference will be the way in which guidance is carried out.

### Other details
* For guides, we will offer mentoring and training in how to guide effectively
* For everyone, we will offer guidance on how to write objectives and results and get the most out of the process
* Most of the time a guide will be a Vizzuality staff member, if there isn’t someone  suitable internally (typically for specialist knowledge) we can look for an external guide.

## How objectives and results work and could be written

Each quarter, before meeting with your guide, you will write down what you want in your professional life in the form of objective and results. Why this way? It’s a format used widely across many organisations that allows you to capture what you want to aspire to with some stepping stone results along the way. They’re often referred to as OKRs.

### What should objectives be about?

Objectives should be around your professional growth:
* continuing to learn new skills and practices,
* improving job performance,
* increasing duties and responsibilities,
* participating in professional organisations.

### How to write objectives with key results

The objective is a high-level statement, typically referring to either something you want to achieve or something you want to become; the common element is a direction or action. Something increases, or decreases, gets faster, slower, is launched, released. For example:

* Increase my technical leadership capabilities from those of a mid-level to a senior
* Increase the code quality across all of our projects
* Reduce the number of bugs in GFW
* Increase the speed of wireframe review process in World bank Maps
* Improve my skills at presenting to clients
* Learn how to talk to the company in Spanish
* Reduce the amount of senior developer interventions on my code in i2i
* Reduce the time by half that it takes to produce financial reports
* Treble the number of companies referencing Vizzuality in their marketing
* Increase the income from grant bodies by 400k
* Increase the number of people forking and talking about Vizzuality’s open source projects

Notice all these objectives have a few things in common.
* They are very active statements, mostly directional, sometimes action based. They are either about improving yourself or improving something else.
* They are all achievable, some more ambitious than others. I’d always err on the side of more ambitious.
* The statements are also unambiguous: there is an element of precision in them (‘by 20%....’, ‘across 100% of projects’....)
* Note, they can be about projects, but importantly they are about what you would do on a project.

As stated above, the success or failure to reach these objectives are not directly tied to salary so please, be ambitious! We are trying to save nature and slow climate change. That takes ambition!

You will notice that each of these objectives are not especially measurable, that is where the results come in. Under each objective there are a set of results. This is a statement of what you plan to achieve in order to reach the objectives. Think of them as a series of stepping stones, typically a more measurable result to achieve. Here are some examples based on the above objectives.

**Objective x. Increase my technical leadership capabilities from those of a mid-level to a senior**

* Result 1. In 3 months I will have completed a mentoring training course and an intern is  mentored successfully.
* Result 2. In 3 months I have lead the architectural design of a major feature of GFW and published to production.
* Result 3. In 1 month there is a blog post describing how we implemented the Mapbox GL library into the layer manager.


**Objective y. Deliver Half-Earth Mapping Platform to the highest possible standard**

* Result 1. Every week all features have been reviewed and estimated and the client is aware.
* Result 2. In 1 month I have successfully organised and run a design sprint with clear outputs produced.
* Result 3. The final release is online without any launch stopping bugs 2 weeks before the launch date.

**Objective z. Increase the code quality of all our projects**

* Result 1. By February there is agreed guidance for standardised coding practices across all teams.
* Result 2. All projects I work on have a >60% unit test coverage
* Result 3. 100% code written in all k-team projects follow the pull request model outlined in the guidance document

Notice a few things in the results. All have a time frame. All can be scored if you need to, either by a binary 0 (fail) or 1 (success) or a gradation 0.5 (I did half of what the result stated). All should be ambitious but at least partly achievable. All should be specific. All are results, **not tasks**. I’ll try and explain that:

* **A task is:** Next Tuesday I will write a guidance document about code quality.
* **A result is:** There is a guidance document available in the vizzuality playbook about code quality.

It may seem like language trickery, and in some cases, it kind of is. However the idea of making it results-focused is to make sure you have multiple ways to achieve an output. How you do it is up to you. What you plan to create is the thing that is fixed. In some cases it might require multiple people to achieve the result. That is fine.

### Checklist for your Objectives and Results

#### Objectives
* Does the objective have direction and/or action (Increase, Decrease, - Faster, Slower, Reduce, Deliver etc)
* Does the objective contain something about improving yourself or something else?
* Is it achievable in the short-mid term?
* Is it ambitious?
* Is it unambiguous?

#### Results
* Is there a time element (‘...by May...’, ‘In 3 weeks...’, ‘Every day…’, ‘In 3 months…’ etc)
* Can you measure it either in a binary way or a scale (‘100%  of x is done’, ‘3 sprints are complete…’ etc)
* Is it difficult but achievable within 3 months?
* Make sure it’s not a task, rather a result.
* Can you look at it in 3 months and understand what is means.
* Is it legible, Could Craig understand it? Could a non-expert understand it?

#### Things still to write/do:

* A training programme for the guides.
* Identify the guides.
* Build this into the HR position
* When to change guides
* Create a list of external guides we can call upon. (Note this is different to training)
* Model the cost of external guides.
* Define and test where to publish the goals.
* Write Salary and bonuses guidance.

# Feedback Loops at Vizzuality: Acting on Feedback

## *Overview*

The idea here is to lay out a set of principles that should be universally applied when giving and taking feedback, regardless of the context that feedback is being given or received, and should be used as a guideline for both participants in the process.

***

## Nurturing a Culture

The goals are:

- Everyone is comfortable and open.
- We address challenges together.
- We have clear expectations.
- There's no such thing as a stupid question.
- There are ongoing positive and/or corrective processes for everyone.
- We all make it a priority to improve each other and the whole organization. 

Every day, we should aim to improve ourselves, the company, and offer useful feedback to our peers.

***

## When to request Feedback

If you feel like you haven't had any feedback in a while (*> 1 week*) then it's on you to seek it.

This can be as simple as approaching one of your peers or your PM about the work you've been doing recently.

Also, try to be specific about what *exactly* you want feedback about? Refer to the [Giving Feedback doc](giving_feedback.md) for help here.

***

## Receiving Feedback and Acting on it Effectively

These principles are focused on how to act during/after receiving feedback in order for the process to be impacful:

1. **Clarify**
   
   Summarise the plan, do you know where you are now and where you need to be to improve? Do you fully understand what is the downside of the current approach/behavior, its negative impact, and do you agree that it can be improved? If any points seems unresolved, be open to ask about them explicitly, or if appropriate, revise them. Be open to asking for help of other people, who may have dealt with and overcome similar situations in the past.

2. **Outlining Next Steps**
   
   As soon as possible afterwards, outline the steps you are going to take to act on the feedback given. If you prefer, discuss this during feedback. If there are multiple components, specify each one and how you will achieve each. Identify when and how follow-up will occur and be as specific as possible. Set a time frame for achieving the primary goal and, if appropriate, identify smaller goals along the way. Make some rough notes to help you remember!

3. **Following Up & Bridging the Gap**
   
   On the agreed schedule, meet with the person that gave you feedback and evaluate the progress so far. Check if you were able to meet your goals, and if not, work together on a revised strategy. Review any potential negative side-effects of your strategy, and adapt your plan if needed. If it’s the case, review your next steps and timeline, making sure all of them are clear and achievable.

4. **Self Assessing & Feeding Forward**
   
   Review how you improved. After a feedback the feedback process went, how it went, and monitor how follow-up is progressing. The learning process doesn’t finish when the feedback session closes, this principle is basic and has impact on your colleagues and direct reports, and everyone on the team benefits.

# Company Wide Remote Guidelines

Vizzuality is remote friendly, staff can work remotely from a different city or work from the Madrid, Cambridge or Porto office but sporadically spend mornings/afternoons/days remote.

Employees who are fully remote will normally be required to spend some initial time (between 3 and 6 months) in one of the offices to get to know the team.

Because of the different locations and the flexibility in our working hours we have a few practices to help the team know who is available when, and where.

### For all the team

It's a good practice to use the active/away status on Slack to let others know when you are working. It's also a good practice to check in & out on the general channel to let people know when you start and finish your day (also nice to say Hello and Goodbye to peers).

If you work regularly the same hours everyday, enable working hours in the Google Calendar under `Settings > General > Working hours` to let people know what times you're working and when you're available for meetings. This will warn people if they try to invite you to a meeting outside of these hours.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1506306/43207106-8a661be8-9027-11e8-9149-8fcaec201afb.png)

Some teams use additional practices to improve communication in general and bring the remote and non-remote staff together:

- daily "slack standup" - at the start of your day, describe what you did the day before and what you're planning to achieve today
- weekly calls - the format may differ

### For sporadic remote work

If you will be sporadically remote it's a good idea to let your closer team know in advance, in case there was anything planned that requires your presence.

When you are working remote you can also update your Slack status (using the house icon or a foreign flag based on the country you're in):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1506306/43206864-f49e6138-9026-11e8-9e12-3e2da157000c.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1506306/43206930-1ec081f8-9027-11e8-9eea-ddbf08732ace.png)

If you are abroad, update your Time Zone in `Profile & account > Edit Profile > Time Zone` so other people know which is your current time. Alternatively, you can just click on your name on any of your messages and click on _Edit your profile_.

# Feedback Loops Roadmap

### Next Steps / Timeline

- Build concrete guidline doc (flow diagram?) for giving/recieving feedback
    - Add general rules for framing the system (frequency of feedback, who to seek it from, how, central axioms)
    
- Champions/Ambassadors 
    - Create doc & selection
    - General framework for each of the different interactions
    - Pilot scheme
    
- Scaffold behaviour (Phase 2)

***

### Open/Unanswered Questions

Things that need to be discussed moving forwards. See the [open-questions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eGlzH5fOxIchVyLRipWBrNBIgdQ18-BHVmVD-PnEmoI/edit#heading=h.aqcfnjgggoxb) to keep up-to-date.

Areas/Contexts that have not been addressed:

1. Replacing/Augmenting Performance Reviews

    At this stage have addressed formative (ongoing) feedback, but we are lacking a solution to summative (end of line) feedback, mainly in the context of formal reviews.

2. Knowledge Sharing

    Teaching eachother. Not getting bogged down in problems that others have solved.

3. [Retrospectives](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/retrospective/)

    Creating guidlines for retrospectives. What have we learned? What can be done better? If we do this it also lends well to feedforward processes...

4. Feedforward

    How do we set ourselves up in kick-offs so that we work with more efficiency? Should we have a guideline for documenting the things learned?

5. Automated Feedback

    Using testing as a means of feedback for devs.

# Salary Review 2021

  

## Overview:

-   Everyone at Vizz has to do a Self Reflection exercise in preparation for the salary conversation they will have with the Exec during Q1-Q2 2021.
    
-   The guideline below was consented by the team on 19th January 2021, following a group consent decision making proposal (23 Consent, 0 Objections)
    
-   This proposal will be in place only during the current salary conversations (Q1 & Q2 2021) as we will be working in an improved process for next year.
    

  

Proposal: For the original proposal please [click here](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/proposal-unfreezing-salary-conversations-117958)

  

# Purpose (Why)

  

In a self - organising team like ours, the degree to which we can each understand and manage our own performance and development will determine whether or not we succeed as an organisation.

  

More specifically, this initiative will allow you/us:

  

-   To raise your own awareness and understanding in regards to your contributions to our purpose, culture, projects, and peers.
    
-   To connect your day to day contributions to your salary review/increase (if applicable)
    
-   To take a few steps forward as a company to increase our sense of accountability (2021 Strategy Planning Survey Results - Priorities)
    

  

To achieve the above, you will be invited to do a Personal Retrospective / Self Reflection about your 2020 contributions and added value, and to then have a conversation with one member of the Exec Team.

  

The whole point of doing this is to create the space to recognise and celebrate the great things you are doing for the company, your team and yourself. And also to reflect on how to improve your performance, continue learning and growing, and also helping Vizzuality achieve its purpose.

  

# The Process

  

As you can see on the image below, the great majority of the process is still the same as before (5 Steps). 

**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OVM1V2VOg44rLT-w22oytY6tDTnOoc0ZWb8AR1miJ9H943tmaeISrdqvWkBx84q8BBOCWMDclW7fWZVMdP6v17-1pftPwNrUsuUgzfcWpZZ1msgx_qKHLtFTKfx9GVlvHBmHND1z)**

The only thing which is changing is an extra step at the very beginning of the process which is intended to help you better prepare to face the process and the conversation you will have with the Exec Team about your salary review.

  

The act of preparing and self reflecting is intended to offer you a tool to empower you to have a better understanding of your contributions, performance and growth, and therefore to have a better and more informed salary conversation.

  

# What do I need to do?

  

You will be preparing a Self Reflection about your last year’s contributions to Vizzuality’s purpose, culture, projects, teams, peers, etc.

  

The activity will require you to stop, reflect and notice what you do at work, your contributions, and what you think that is worth to the company and our purpose.

  

To support you during the reflection exercise, you will be given a set of questions for you to think about. Some of those questions will be optional, but it's recommended you try to reflect on all of them to deepen your understanding.

  

(*) [Self Reflection Template & Guiding Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sb08poKFwuhzktCQ38WmXgi2RSstzRIn02aXWfLaxR8/edit)

  

When you have completed your self reflection, you should discuss it with one member of the Executive Team. (If you have decided to take notes of your self reflection, please feel free to share them in advance of your conversation and/or to take your notes to the session.)

  

Following your conversation, the Exec Team member will validate and calibrate your proposal with the rest of the Exec Team. After the calibration/validation exercise, you will receive a confirmation from the Exec Team on your final raise. The finance team will update your details and only then your salary raise will be effective in your payslip.

  

Who do I talk to? Which member of the Exec team is my point of contact for this conversation?

  

The whole point of these conversations is to create an open, trusting and comfortable space to talk about your salary and growth at Vizz. So, depending on your specific case and preferences this could mean that when having finished your self reflection:

  

-   You reach out to the Exec team member who has always been your point of contact when it comes to salary raises because you feel comfortable talking with him.
    
-   You reach out to the Exec team member you trust the most today.
    

  

If you have any doubts about this guideline, please feel free to reach out to me (People & Culture) and I will help you.

# Security

## Online accounts

This section covers security around online services:

- Use strong passwords for all services (personal or not). A strong password should be unique (not used in multiple services), at least 15 characters long, and mix upper and lower case characters, numbers and special characters. 
- Enable 2FA for all services for which you have an individual account - your email account, Github, AWS, LastPass, etc
- For non personal services auto-generate 15+ character ascii passwords and store in LastPass. Passwords can and will be modified regularly
- Share passwords in folders, not directly with people, then invite people to folders

LastPass allows you to quickly and easily generate passwords that match the criteria above. It can also warn you in case
 it detects you are sharing the same password across multiple services, which you can use to quickly audit your current
 passwords
 
Apart from treating your passwords like you would treat your underwear (Change them often, never share them with anyone, don't leave them on your desk) it's also important to check regularly for possible known data breaches. A useful service for this is provided at https://monitor.firefox.com/ 
 
### What to do in case one of your online accounts is compromised
 
If you suspect a personal or non personal account has been compromised or a device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc) with open sessions or access to 2FA codes has been lost or stolen please:
 
- Ask your colleagues for help
- Close all open sessions
- Change password for all affected services
- Refer to the documentation of the affected service(s) on how to invalidate your lost 2FA device credentials 

## Servers

These rules apply to server management (AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine VM, etc) and similar hosting services:

- For authentication, use SSH public/private key pairs whenever possible, as opposed to passwords. Disable password-based auth on the server.
- Do not share your private key. When sharing access with someone else, ask them for their public key, and add it to the server.
- Limit access to the server using whitelist-type firewall rules (for example, using AWS Security Groups). For most cases, this means enabling access only to ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- Ensure automatic security updates installation is enabled.
- For each application you install - and especially for the ones facing the internet - review and deploy security best practices.

## Sharing passwords

### Internally

When sharing passwords with other team members, do so using LastPass. LastPass entries should be grouped within a LastPass folder, which can then be shared with the project team and ideally also relevant staff from outside of the strict project team, who might be able to step in and help with a project when needed.

### With clients

Each client organisation has different practices around security and password management, making this specific guideline 
less clear. If the client organisation has no specific policy around password management, suggest using LastPass, as it's
a free service anyone can sign up for. 

If the client does not want to adopt LastPass, or already uses another tool for this purpose, use your best judgment on
the best way to share passwords. However you should always keep in mind that the following are NOT safe ways to share
passwords:
- Slack/other chat tools
- Email
- Basecamp
- Hangout/Skype/etc
- Google docs/drive/etc

In certain scenarios, the client will request that we send the password through one of these channels anyway. We should
warn about the security risk of this, and request that the receiving person change that specific password as soon as they
 receive it.

## Internet access

When outside the office/your home, avoid connecting to public wifi networks. There's a [wide range of attacks](http://blog.privatewifi.com/how-wifi-hotspot-hacks-occur/) that can be executed around the concept of wifi hotspots, and even
legitimate hotspots usually track your browsing habits or inject annoying ads into your browser.

As an alternative, you can use a tethered connection from your smartphone to your computer, or use a VPN service when using a public hotspot network.


## Computers

Your computer should have Full Disk Encryption enabled. All modern operating systems support this out of the box 
(Apple calls its implementation FileVault), and the performance impact is negligible or non-existent, depending on
your hardware and OS.

Your login password should be complex enough as to not be guessable through trial-and-errors (avoid relatives names, birth dates, phone numbers, etc).

Be mindful of what devices you connect to your computer. Malware DOES exist for MacOS, and it can be injected into your computer [from where you least expect](https://www.techspot.com/news/75923-british-security-expert-mods-usb-c-apple-charger.html).

## Digital certificates

If you're working or generating digital certificates of any kind - like the ones used by Apple to sign iOS apps, for example - make sure to follow these steps: 

1. Any attached password or username or information required to use it. 
2. What does this certificate have access rights too?
3. Does this certificate have access to NDA material? 
4. Stored in a secure place on LastPass (yes LastPass supports files).
5. If you’re creating a certificate, make sure you're registering it on a company profile, not your own personal credentials. 

If a certificate has to be shared with a client, make sure the certificate does not have access to any other client information than is required. Use the same guidelines as you would use to share a password to share a certificate.

## Other sensitive info

In general, any other types of sensitive info used in projects or services, like secret keys, authorization tokens, etc should be stored and saved through LastPass using the "secure notes" feature. When storing and sharing please include all the relevant info:

- The key ot token itself
- The service/project it is for
- Date of creation (and expiry if appropriate)
- Usage instructions (eg. include on config file)
- Contact person

## Github

If you use git and Github, this section is for you. If you don't, move along, here be dragons.


### Authentication

Like in all services, be sure to use a strong password. 2 factor authentication is a requirement - if you don't have it enabled, you won't be able to join the Vizzuality Github organization, and thus will not be able to push code changes. Refer to [this link](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication) for instructions on how to do so.

### Transfer protocol

Github supports two main methods of communicating with their servers: SSH or HTTPS. Both are secure, and can be used 
interchangeably. You can find a detailed comparison of these two options (and a few others) [in this link](https://gist.github.com/grawity/4392747).
You should always use one of these two methods, as they are the only ones with security built in. You can find
 Github's recommendation [here](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/) - this has been known
 to change frequently, so don't worry if you are not using their recommended version. Also keep in mind that they 
 behave in slightly different ways during day-to-day usage, as SSH requires less password management over HTTPS.

### Signing commits

While not required, it's strongly recommended that you sign your commits using a GPG key to protect against 
[commit spoofing](https://medium.com/@pjbgf/spoofing-git-commits-7bef357d72f0). The process is similar to generating SSH
keys, and you can find the instructions to do so [in this link](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/).
Signed commits will display a "Verified" message next to them - you can see an example of this in PR merge commits.

### Deploy keys

In some scenarios, certain Github projects need to be cloned onto servers or other similar environments. When doing so,
and if you need to grant that environment access to your Github account (for example, to clone a private repository), 
be sure to use a [deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/) instead of a traditional 
SSH key. 

## NPM and published libraries
When creating a module to NPM enable 2FA for the publishing and settings update following the recommendations stated above.

# Sick leave guideline

This guideline is intended to inform about two different procedures. On the one hand, the general principles that all Vizzuality employees must follow for internal communication. And on the other hand, report on the legal processes to be followed in each country in the event of prolonged sick leave.

The guideline is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible scenarios that might arise; flexibility for individual and unique circumstances will be accepted and considered.

*Please remember that working and sending emails and/or slack messages when you are on a sick leave prescripted by a doctor is not permitted and it may induce to legal actions against the company*

  

## Applicable to all employees

  

As soon as you know that you are sick and will not be able to work/go to the office, you should let your PM/team know so they can organize the workload.

  

The next step should be using the “I’m sick” workflow option, using the workflow found on the left-hand side of the message box at the #general channel.

  

Also, update your slack status with the sick emoji `:face_with_thermometer:`. This will be helpful for anyone trying to contact you that missed the previous steps.

  

And lastly, make sure to record the sick leave in [BambooHR](https://vizzuality.bamboohr.com/login.php). Click on “Request time off”, introduce the days of the sick leave and select the “medical leave” option.

  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PN20rsBQra_hlf6LQcJCPUaC6marliQgFPFy5qtc7lZTfBrnUZwicsNOFwRifOIcL-jyOohtHOoieg6kAmHwiGSst_0IA5uxz_OBjzMYNJMZebqMESaWhqQbxpAEyGAJ2UcGmgsm)

*In the event that you wake up feeling a bit under the weather but are able to work from home, please let your PM/team know about it and explain your availability in case you need to go to the doctor, pharmacy etc.

  
  

## Spain employees:

  

Following the labour law in Spain, employees should go to the doctor to get a certificate (justificante médico) when they are sick and will not work, but the company will be flexible in this aspect and will only request it in specific cases. Only after the third day of sickness, the employee needs to go to the medical centre and request a sick leave (la baja médica), only granted by a doctor after a medical exam.

  

Please make sure to scan or take a photo of the sick note and send it to @Liuba and @Daniel Galvez so they can contact the “asesoría” and send the documents to process the sick leave.

  

<span style="color:blue">*If the sick leave is due to COVID-19, you need to let us know specifically, as the Asesoría will process it as an “accidente laboral”. You will benefit from this by receiving 100% of your salary during the sick leave.*</span>

  

**COVID-19: During this uncertain period, if you are sick for any reason, you need to call your designated medical centre and they will give you all the steps to follow in case of sickness and the admin information needed to request a sick note. You can also find some information [here](https://prevencion.fremap.es/Parallax/coronavirus/index.html)**

  
  
  

## Portugal employees:

  

Due to the special context of the labour law of Portugal, employees must go to the doctor on day one to request a sick leave but in effort to be equal to other employees, the company will be flexible for the first 3 days, so the employee does not need to get a document from their family doctor.

  

After the third day of sickness, the employee needs to go to the Médico de Família and request a sick note (baixa médica), only granted by the doctor after a medical exam.  Please make sure to scan or take a photo of the sick note and send it to @Liuba and @Daniel Galvez so they can contact the consultancy company (Edit Value) and send the documents to process the sick leave.

  

**COVID-19: During this uncertain period, if you are sick for any reason, you need to call your designated medical centre and they will give you all the steps to follow in case of sickness and the admin information needed to request a sick note. You can also find some information [here](http://www.seg-social.pt/covid-19-perguntas-e-respostas#)**

  
  
  
  
  
  

## UK employees:

  

Employees must request a fit note to the GP if they’ve been ill for more than 7 days in a row and have taken sick leave. This includes non-working days, such as weekends and bank holidays. Please make sure to scan or take a photo of the sick note and send it to @Liuba and @Daniel Galvez so they can contact the consultancy company (Kingston Smith), and send the documents to process the sick leave.

  

Fit notes are free if the employee has been ill for more than 7 days when they ask for one. The doctor might charge a fee if they ask for the fit note earlier. The fit note will say the employee is either ‘not fit for work’ or ‘may be fit for work’.

If it says the employee ‘may be fit for work’, employers should discuss any changes that might help the employee return to work (for example, different hours or tasks). The employee must be treated as ‘not fit for work’ if there’s no agreement on these changes.

  

**COVID-19: if employees are self-isolating and cannot work because of coronavirus, they can get an [‘isolation note’ online from NHS 111](https://111.nhs.uk/isolation-note/). They do not have to go to their GP or a hospital.**

  
  
  

## Remote employees:

  

For those specific cases where a Vizzuality employee is working in a different country than those mentioned above, please make sure you get the correct information on how to proceed in case you need to request sick leave. If you need any help with this, please contact @Daniel Galvez and he will be happy to assist you.

# Rapid Sketching

## Useful for. 
Rapidly creating lots of different ways to solve a certain problem.

## How to do it. 
First settle on a certain problem (“how do users find interesting datasets”) or a page you want to try and prototype (home page, map page). Everyone in the group gets a piece of A4 paper. Fold it in half 2 times, then back out again - you should have a page with 4 segments. You have 10 minutes to sketch 4 different ways to solve that problem/ lay out that page. 

**A good example.** WB Maps [pictures of the sketches we made](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WvCIKXvSgFTMOmoyqYV8WcTdBTo-tOoa) and [agenda we followed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvXBJRyBKdxLtAnHPrMQ9xVjJCp2HGBvrvsSZW2u_14/edit)

**Time needed.** 50 minutes. 5 minutes to set up, 10 minutes to think, 20 minutes to present, 15 minutes to vote and discuss

# Slack Guidelines
## Motivations
The aim of the slack guidelines is to: (1) help on transparency, organisation of information, (2) reduce noise and lack of focus, which lead to more efficiency and better well being.

Slack is expected to be an asynchronous form of communication. It is not aimed at documenting decisions and storing important documents.

-   Synchronous communication: communication that happens in real-time, with instant reads and responses.
    
-   Asynchronous communication: communication that does not happen in real-time, where responses are intermittent and delayed.
    

  

## Customise Notification and View settings

Get familiar with the Slack preferences and options to customise notifications and the view, this can be helpful to reduce the noise and increase the focus.

Below are helpful links to best practices and tips on managing your notifications and reducing noise in Slack.

-   [Reduce noise in Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218551977-Reduce-noise-in-Slack)
    
-   [Configure Your Notifications](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/201355156-Guide-to-desktop-notifications#configure-your-notifications)
    
-   [Guide to Desktop Notifications](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/201355156-Guide-to-desktop-notifications#channel-specific-and-group-dm-notifications)
    
-   [Channel-specific and group DM Notifications](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/201355156-Guide-to-desktop-notifications#channel-specific-and-group-dm-notifications)
    
-   [Display only unread conversations](https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections#manage-conversation-display)
    
-   [Mute channels](https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages)
    

Consider using Slack's [Sections](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections) to categorise channels and set up their visibility on the side bar.

### Recommended customisation

-   **Look & Feel**: As you explore the preferences of Slack, you might want to change the theme to use the Vizzuality colours for the sidebar. `#000000,#222222,#000000,#FFE229,#222222,#FFFFFF,#2BA4A0,#2BA4A0,#222222,#FFFFFF`
    

-   **Sections**: You can organise your channels in Slack using [sections](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections).  
    This is very personal and depending on how you want to organise your slack you choose how categorise the channels. Some ways are categorising by project, functional area, topic, or how frequently you have to check them...
    
-   **Channel presence**: Make sure you regularly do a channel purge. Remember, leaving a channel is not a problem, come and go as you like.  
    
-   The [status and availability in Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability)  can help inform everyone on how quickly you might be able to respond. You can use a custom status and duration, but we have some predefined ones in our workspace:  
    - `In a meeting`: (lasts an hour) It synchronises with your Google Calendar, or you can put it manually.  
    - `Nom nom nom break`: (lasts an hour) break time for lunch.  
    - `BRB!`: (permanent) to notify when you are away from the computer or busy.  
    - `Vacationing`: Use this status to notify of your absence because of vacations.  
    - `Working remotely`: To notify you are working from a remote location.
    

  

# Usage guidelines

While the customisation of slack is a personal choice, the usage guidelines explain what is expected from each individual when creating channels and sending messages.

## Conflict resolution

Slack is a place to discuss topics, and in Vizzuality we embrace conflict in a positive way. In Slack we follow the same rules of communication we follow on the rest of channels in Vizzuality, you a have a couple of link to know more about this:

-   [Conflict resolution guidelines.](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/conflict-resolution/)
    
-   Blogin Post about SMO: [Embracing conflicts](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/98949).
    
-   Using [non-violent communication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDFKsCQOezYqXbdphi4kXRK_rpmAyPMGSFeSIvKFD0k/edit?usp=sharing).
    

## Channel Life Cycle

Anyone can create a channel. There is a list of current channels in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18FrEu9G8pH7LSe13YnwxfZusUDzsbuzk5wFOT7La4Xc/edit#gid=0), it is updated monthly with a manual trigger.

### Guidelines to add a new channel:

1.  Use the search bar in slack to see if there is a channel with the topic of interest, you can also check the channel [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18FrEu9G8pH7LSe13YnwxfZusUDzsbuzk5wFOT7La4Xc/edit#gid=0) to see if there is already a channel for your purpose.
    
2.  Set a channel name that states the purpose of the channel, use the naming nomenclature. Be highly descriptive in the name. Where appropriate use the full project or Functional Area names especially where acronyms are not well known (e.g. `#half-earth-whatever`, not `#he-whatever`).
    

    1.  use hyphen/dash separators
    
    2.  Name should include one or several of the following:
    

        -   `<project name>` and/or
    
        -   `<functional area>`
    
        -   `<theme>` e.g. quality, SMO, comms, etc
    
        -   `<task>` e.g. retro, workshop, proposal, QA/QC etc
    
        -   `<time>` e.g. year and/or quarter
    
        -   `<shared status>` i.e. include 'shared' if shared with another org
    
        -   `legal-<people-affected>-<theme>` (more information below)
    

4.  Add a description to the channel:
    

    -  Purpose: why this channel exist and who is expected to be in the channel
    
    -  Related channels
    
    -  Channel handle (optional, see more about channel handles below)
    

6.  Invite all relevant parties
    
7.  Monitor the usage of the channel. When you create a channel you are responsible for achieving it when its use is no longer necessary.
    

### Closing guidelines:

1.  Inform the channel of the planned closure
    
2.  Channel must be archived after used
    

  

## Channels vs Direct messages

### Public channels

Public Slack channels are used for digital communication. This saves time in filling others in on statuses of projects and helps collaboration.
People on a channel are interested in the discussion of a topic right now. When decision-making is needed, a clear timeline should be stated and the affected parties directly informed (tagging individuals or user groups) to ensure asynchronous reviewing. This ensures that people can be present, leave and rejoin channels as they please, remember, the affected parties are tagged when necessary.


-   `@channel` or `@here` should be avoided unless really necessary - meaning everyone in that channel should be **immediately** aware of something. Find out more about these handles in the [slack documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/articles/202009646-Notify-a-channel-or-workspace#:~:text=%40everyone%20notifies%20every%20person%20in,active%20members%20of%20a%20channel.&text=If%20there%20are%2010%2C000%20members,use%20%40channel%20or%20%40here)
    
-   Find out if the channel uses a group handle (this information should be in the description of the channel).
    
-   Discussions should be kept within threads and the outcome of the conversation shared as well in the channel. The `:thread:` emoji is used to remind of this guideline. Discussion threads make the page history easily navigable and reduces the noise in any given channel down to a simple index of topics. Remember that slack is not aimed at documenting dicisions, make sure the outcome is properly documented outside of Slack (e.g. project folder, wiki...)
    
-   Acknowledge reading messages with an emoji. Unlikely threads, reacting with an emoji does not automatically start to follow a thread and reduces the number of notifications.
    

### Direct messages

When using direct messages be aware that direct messages discourage collaboration. You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help. You might rather use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. In that way it is easier for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.

-   Project related conversations should happen in project channels.
    

### Group direct messages

When using group direct messages keep in mind that they are very hard to maintain, track and respond to. You might want to consider whether the conversation can take place in a public channel.

## Channels

### User group handles

From the side bar you can see which [user groups](https://slack.com/intl/en-es/help/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group) already exist (People and user groups - this may be hidden inside the `More...` tab). Some channels have specified user groups (check the description of the channel). Also user group handles allow to reduce the noise of using `@channel` and `@here`. Each individual can choose to be in a user group. So far there are two useful types of handles:

-   **User groups of a functional area**: `@backend`, `@bd`, `@designers`, `@resigners`, `@fronterizos`, `@pms`, `@researchers`, `@science`. These handles are useful to notify people from a Functional area in a channel where they are not expected to be or there is not knows representative. The `:at:` emoji is used to remind of this guideline and you can use a thread to mention the user group.
    
-   **User groups of a project**: These are useful handles for daily stand ups or important project notifications. Depending on the development status of the project different people will be part of the handle. It is the responsibility of each individual to be inside the handle.
    

  

### General Channels

These are channels with general topics:

-   `#announcements`: where all company announcements are shared, the message should be succinct and inform on any deadline and place for further discussion (slack channel or Blogin or google doc). `@channel` and `@here` shouldn’t be used unless urgent response is required by everybody;
    
-   `#general`: Where we have work related company-wide discussions, say good morning and celebrate team achievements, welcome new staff, birthdays, vizzdays and births;
    
-   `#random`: For random non-work related topics;
    
-   `#recognition`: To give praise to our teammates.
    

### Operational and internal initiatives channels

These channels do not have constant activity but they are operational and concentrate conversations related to the internal functioning of Vizzuality. These channels often affect everyone in the company or a big portion, make sure the creation of this channel is broadly announced.

#### Operational channels:

-   `#all-hands`: where we work on our playbook and the all hands call agenda is shared.
-    `vizz-tracker`: where issues and questions about VizzTracker are shared. 
    
-   `#one-team`: where we organise discussions on internal functioning.
    
-   `#blogin-taxonomy`: where we iterate on the taxonomy of Blogin categories.

- `#capacity-planning`: where capacity for new and ongoing projects is organised. Use the `request a team for new project` workflow to reach the functional area representatives.
    
-   `#remote-experience`: to discuss material and practices that should improve remote interactions.

-   `#madrid-office-bookings`: to coordinate the use of the Madrid office.
    

#### IMPORTANT NOTE: Legal matters (e.g.: contracts, insurance) will be directly informed to those affected by email. If further discussion is needed amongst a group, Operations will create a channel to discuss the topic. The channel will follow the nomenclature: `#legal-<people-affected>-<theme>` (e.g. `#legal-madrid-risk-assessment`, `#legal-remote-spain-law`).

#### Internal initiatives channels:

The initiatives that have a channel are listed in a [live document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pr7QW5S54IeravFQ7A-2Vf8lkTySRgqO7eeDnTqcLHk/edit#gid=0).

  

### Functional Area channels

Join functional areas channels if you are interested in keeping up with updates from those areas. Remember the user group handles to ping them in channels that are not these ones. The expected people in these channels are those that belong to the FA.

-   `#backend-devs`
    
-   `#communications-team`
    
-   `#frontismos`
    
-   `#pms-united`
    
-   `#real-design-room`
    
-   `#scienceteam`
    

### Project channels

#### Proposal projects

`#business-dev`: Discussion and writing proposals for new work. Information on the development status of proposals is found here. From this channel teams are created to write new proposals. It is the responsibility of each FA to state how the information should flow from this channel to the rest of the members of the FA.

`#bd-<project-name>-proposal` type of channels are used to coordinate the writing of proposals. If the proposal is accepted, the channel is renamed to become an ongoing project. If the proposal is not successful the channel is archived. All the important documentation should be in the Proposal Folder.

  

#### Ongoing projects

Join project related channels if you are interested in keeping up with updates from those teams. Depending on the project or the cycle moment of the project other project related channels might be created and any decision carried out inside reported back to the main project channel.

-   `#<Project name>-channel`: Debriefing from client meetings, broadcasting outcomes from meetings, discussions on the wide scope of the project live here.
    

-   `#<Project name>-dev`: The different team members should ask for information to other members in this channel during the development of the channel.
    

-   `#<Project name>-<fa>`: Large projects with several people from the same functional area might have a subchannel to carry out discussions. The #project-name-channel must be updated with updates and decisions.
    

### Social Channels (not an exhaustive list)

-   Thematic: `#books`, `#gamez`, `#music`, `#pets`, `#run`
    
-   Geographic: `#madrizz`, `#uk-crew`, `#portugal`




# Supporting a peer with low-performance

(*) This guideline was approved by [group consent](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/supporting-a-peer-with-low-performance-proposal-for-consent-198224) on February 3rd 2023.

  

## **Purpose**

  

This proposal is intended to **support teams when it comes to addressing a continued reduction in performance in the team (ie. low-performance) while helping their peers grow and improve.**

  

Some of the questions the guideline will try to answer:

 - *If there are no bosses, can underperformers just hang around forever?*
 - **What should I do if a colleague is not performing correctly?* What sort of help is available?*  
 - *What are the consequences of a repeated lack of accountability and underperformance?*  
 - *How do we do this in alignment with our principles and our SMO culture?*

    

  

To build the proposal we considered inputs and insights from the accountability workshops we did last year, learnings from previous low performance cases, as well as advice from several people on the team.

  

## **High Level Process**

  

Is there a difference between **“poor” or “very poor”** performance? A performance lapse becomes ‘very’ poor as time passes and the reduction becomes continued and repetitive. What helps is understanding the **time period that someone has not been meeting expectations**, and how we will set up support systems and tools to help a peer improve their performance at Vizz.

**Temporary Performance Lapse ( > 4 weeks )** 
- 1. You notice someone is not performing as expected 
- 2. Give Feedback 

**Performance Issue Persists ( 4 - 8 weeks )**  
- 3. Gather additional perspectives 
- 4. Group Conversation 

**Long Term Performance Issue ( 9+ weeks )** 
- 5. Performance Improvement Plan
- 6. Decision Making

  

## 1. You notice someone is not performing as expected.

    

  

Everyone has had a short period of poor performance at some time (< 4 weeks). This is nothing out of the ordinary - it happens to the best.

  

If someone is underperforming, this usually means the person is failing to perform the responsibilities of their job (ie. pledges, roles, onboarding, etc.) or to perform it at a level considered acceptable.

  

There are three main types of underperformance:

-   **Skills & Knowledge** - the person has some critical technical skills or knowledge gaps that stop them from delivering at the level/quality required of them.
    
-   **Accountability** - the person struggles to get things done, fulfill commitments and responsibilities, or work productively in our environment.
    
-   **Behaviors** - the person doesn’t follow company guidelines, live up to our principles, or contribute to a healthy environment.
    

  

## 2. Give feedback

    

  

The first level of feedback, as described in our [accountability guideline](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/guidelines/Accountability-when-working-together.html) should always come from your peers (ie. same FA, Project team, other FAs/Teams). 

**A peer could be anyone at Vizzuality that might notice an improvement area(s)** in your performance, accountability, or behaviors.

  

Once you identify signs of underperformance, you should provide feedback to your peers as soon as possible, try to help them get back on track, and rebuild their confidence early on.

  

A few tips and good practices:

-   Give feedback **when the issue/situation is small** and it doesn’t take so much energy to address.
    
-   **Take your time** to [prepare for feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wPvq9-_owRBl1oiwkZwODa8ZixG7OG8a4Zrvomh4_fA/edit). This will help you (the feedback provider) to reflect and organize your ideas/feedback before giving it.
    
-   **Invite the other person to a meeting/call** and explain the reason for it (“I would like to offer you feedback. Is this ok? ”). This will allow the other person to get into the right mindset and will also allow the conversation to be smoother and clearer for everyone involved.
    
-   Finally, **summarize and share your feedback** in a slack message or shared document. (A written document will help the person receiving the feedback to understand the message clearly and also for future reference).
    

  

## 3. Gather additional perspectives.

    

  

If the feedback you have provided is not well received, if you don't see visible progress, and/or if you are unsure about how to move forward, please **share the situation with someone else who also knows the other person’s work**:

-   *This is what I am experiencing with this person and how it's affecting me and the team. Are you experiencing something similar? Am I missing something?*
-   *Is the feedback I am planning to give objective and relevant?*
-   *What am I doing (not doing) that could be contributing to the issue?*
    

  

The main objective is to **get a better perspective and understanding of the situation**. To achieve this please share the situation and gather additional perspectives from **whomever you consider relevant** (ie. Same FA, Different FA, PMs, Exec Team, etc.)

  

## 4. Group Conversation: Alignment & Next Steps.

    

  

If the performance issue persists (4 - 8 weeks), we will get the relevant people together and make sure everyone:

-   Manages the same information and understands the feedback that has already been given
-   Review the patterns in performance issues and assess the impacts
-   Assess the need of defining a Performance Improvement Plan and the type of support the person might be needing to improve
    

  

Please document (ie. Google Docs) the main ideas and actions from the conversation and share them with everyone involved/relevant.

  

***Who should be involved in the group conversation?*** The person with low performance and the feedback provider(s) / relevant people. Please include People & Culture and/or the Exec Team for support if needed (especially when it comes to thinking about performance improvement plans)

  

## 5. Performance improvement plan

    

  

If the reduction in performance has been continued and a challenge for some time (9+ weeks), you want your next conversation to be focused on discussing a formalized Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).

  

A PIP should be a **genuine last opportunity to resolve underperformance before exploring the possibility of terminating the person’s contract**. But a PIP is ineffective if you don’t believe your peer can improve. Therefore, only do a PIP if you are confident that the outcome could be successful.

  

### 5a. Designing the Plan

It’s important to **define clear agreements** (deliverables, timelines and impact measures) and design the plan to be **short in scope and time (4 - 6 weeks)**, so it's easier to focus on and quick to see progress. (The plan timelines could be extended or modified depending on the specific case)

  

When designing the plan please use this [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iREkG3xC_p5O4gyOyPEDBR9bqUrREOs03rjVEPttgMU/edit?usp=sharing).

  

The **person with low performance** will be the main responsible for leading their improvement efforts and defining their own plan.

  

A **“support peer” who understands the person's day-to-day job**, will work with the person to get a better understanding of their specific needs, will help with the plan design, and provide support when the plan is being implemented. The support peer will also be responsible for the plan sign-off.

  

*****(For more information**** about the criteria and process for electing a support peer please check the **FAQ section**.*)

  

**People & Culture.** Please inform and seek help from the People & Culture team to design and follow up on the plan.

  

**Additional support.** Depending on the case, more people on the team could be also involved and provide support (ie. Senior team member, Exec Team)

  

### 5b. Periodic Check-Ins

The **person with low performance leading the plan** is responsible to schedule and facilitate these periodic check-ins (weekly or bi-weekly) and also to self-report on how they believe they are doing. While the **support peer** responsibility is to help follow up/review progress and provide feedback. Please ensure you document progress toward goals.

  
  

### 5c. Final Review

  

Having passed the final deadline of the plan, the person leading the plan will meet their support peer to review commitments and progress. (Other people could also be involved if relevant)

  

In advance of the session:

-   The **person leading the plan** will do a self-reflection and assessment of their progress (performance, responsibilities, learnings, etc.) and gather feedback from peers (if relevant)
    
-   The **support peer** will also do an assessment of the plan, and gather feedback from peers (if relevant)
    

  

## 6. Decision Making

    

  

At this stage, we have 3 outcomes and possible actions:

-   **Plan Achieved:** When the person has responded positively by meeting plan objectives, you can formally close the PIP. This is a big accomplishment for the person, but be sure the person understands that this level of good performance needs to continue beyond the PIP.
    
-   **Plan Extension:** If your peer is meeting some, but not all deliverables, consider extending the PIP. The additional time may allow them to finish the outstanding work and put you in a better position to fully evaluate the PIP.
    
-   **No Progress:** If the person does not meet the expectations laid out in the PIP, it might be clear that the person is not fit for the team and/or organization. Please update the PIP document to reflect this and reach out to P&C and Exec team to evaluate whether termination is now appropriate.
    

  

# FAQ

  

## ***1. Is this guideline only to be used by Execs and People & Culture?***

  

Not at all. We trust everyone at Vizz, regardless of their seniority or length in the company, to demonstrate individual leadership in helping their peers improve their performance and accountability.

  

Help and support will always be available (ie. Execs, People & Culture), but if you see something that needs addressing and could be improved, please get started by giving feedback to your peer and asking for support if needed.

  

## ***2. What if at some point things get “complicated” and a conflict arises between people?***

  

As per our company [guidelines](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/conflict-resolution/), when a conflict happens we have a shared responsibility to help resolve it, starting always with the people directly involved. If you need support with Conflict Resolution or are in need of mediation, please ask People & Culture or the Exec Team for help.

  

## ***3. It looks like the support peer is very important for the PIP, as they sign off the plan and assess it. That comes with a lot of responsibility, but it is not clear how they are elected or whether they may refuse. Does the person leading the plan have a say in this?***

  

*"How are they elected?"*

In stage “4. Group Conversation” all the relevant people will assess the need of implementing a PIP and the type of support needed, including the definition of who is the best person to perform the support role.

  

When it comes to deciding who should be a support peer, there are 2 elements that will work together:

-   Someone who understands very well the person's role and responsibilities (regardless if they were the first to provide feedback).
    
-   A strong willingness and desire to support a peer to improve their performance and grow at Vizz
    

  

It's important to note that if relevant and useful, we could have more than 1 support peer to provide better support to the person (ie. Someone senior from the same FA and a project peer from another FA). Also, the Exec Team and/or P&C will always be available to support the person leading the plan, the support peer, and anyone else who might need it, throughout the process.

  

*"May they refuse?"*

Yes of course. We will never mandate or impose a support role on a person.

  

However, I would like to note that high performance is only possible when we look at it as a team effort and take responsibility for one another. As described in our [Growth Framework](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/guidelines/growth-framework.html), an important element of demonstrating personal leadership and creating impact at Vizz is achieved by actively helping improve team performance and supporting other people's growth, especially when it comes to senior roles.

  

Now, if following the conversation described in point 4, the group considers that someone in the team is in the best position to support a peer with low performance, but the person doesn't want to do it, we need to understand the reasons. For example

-   *I don’t have enough seniority/knowledge/skills to support the person*
-   *I don't have the motivation/care/don't want to spend time supporting a peer.*
-   *Never done it before. I am a bit scared as it's a big responsibility and I need extra support*
-   *Is it something else?*
    

  

Based on the above responses, we will then reassess the options we have and the possible impacts of that decision, so we can provide the support needed to the person with low performance.

  

*"Does the person leading the plan have a say in this?"*

Of course, they will. The person leading the plan will be involved in the Group Conversation in which is discussed the PIP, and will be able to express their opinion about who they feel more comfortable working with moving forward (always considering the 2 criteria described above).

# Information flow

In the last few days, we have been collecting the feedback from vizzcamp and we now have a plan of going forward.

Our conclusion collecting the feedback.

Our concepts

  - transparency
  - reliability
  - accessibility
  - productivity

have overall been validated, but we have been too abstract. We focused on too many topics and looking at other groups at vizzcamps we saw that they were focusing on a handful of concrete topics and giving concrete solutions for those.

## Our plan going forward

Focusing on solving the most important issues: **mainly project communications** (we’ll touch upon other things as well)

Let’s not reinvent the wheel! **Doing an archeology of existing guidelines to see what has been documented previously in vizzuality**

what we have found is that there are plenty and plenty of guidelines already exist, so the question is:

Why are these previous guidelines not followed? there is a lot of great information already written. but for some reason, there is no action taken on a lot of these guidelines.


### solutions we need to find

- How to make people read and implement the guidelines?
- define ownership of these documents?
- create templates so information is easy to navigate/read
- make documentation fun! how can we make this information fun to read/write and share

### Meeting actions

we have now split into 2 groups

One group working on synthesizing and improving the existing guidelines.

One group is thinking of concrete strategies to implement these guidelines.


We hope that this action will make us land some concrete solutions and guidelines how to approach information flow.

# Training Budget 

(This guideline was approved following a Group Consent Decision on March 8th 2021. For the original blogspot proposal please [click here](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/training-budget-2021-proposal-for-consent-121529))

  
## Purpose

  

The Training Budget benefit aims to improve learning, mastery and growth both at individual and organisational level, by providing financial resources/support (1500 Eur a year) that our people can use both for paying training/learning as well as using it as learning hours.

  

## Principles

  

-   **Self Reflect & Align:** Before making a decision on how to spend your budget, you should try to align with something bigger than just your immediate individual needs (ie. Purpose, Strategy, Team Contract & Learning Priorities, etc.). You don't have to write down your reflection or share it.
    
-   **Transparency & Accountability:** Whenever you are ready to make your decision, please share it openly with the wider team in the #training-budget slack channel using the workflow we’ve created.
    
-   **Give Back:** It would be great if Vizz could benefit from the things you learn. You could do this by sharing your knowledge and/or by applying the learnings at work.
    

  

## The Process

  

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EMce3V18wZOtcgrJuSK4kKKUIU7xAzxRdj3CbySiRVXA8sDzvpe-n9MLbIt_V_7ol-tV3gbthZ7idVrlS5Op9WUE7XpOJ_vzOLCIZG-f8pkE6FNbljY7ouyD3jyixXDWjo-gnF2z)

  

### I want to learn something “Self Reflection & Alignment”

  

Before making a decision on how to spend your budget, it would be great if you could give a thought to the following questions. “Does this training investment...?

  

-   *Align with our purpose?*
    
-   *Align with this year’s priorities & themes?*
    
-   *Align with your team’s contract and/or learning priorities?* (If you don’t already have team learning priorities maybe you could create the space to get the team together and talk about this?)
    
-   *Align with your own professional development goals?* (Don't have professional development goals/plan? If you have already prepared your Salary Review Conversations, you could refer to your self reflection)
    
-   *Is within both time and cost budgets?* (See below “Can you explain the 1500 Eur”)
    

  

*What if I have doubts?* Please share your ideas with your team to get advice and feedback, or ask other people in the company for help.

  

*Do I need to write down my self reflection?* No one will ask you to share your self reflection and it's not necessary for you to write it down. The most important thing is to take some time to “align with something bigger” (ie. Purpose, Strategy, Your Team, etc.).

  

### I make a decision & inform the team: Transparency & Accountability”

  

Armed with the answers to the above questions you can now make a decision and communicate it to the wider team.

  

-   **Where:** Communicate your proposal in the **#training-budget** slack channel using the workflow. Your proposal will be open for everyone at Vizz to see in the channel (if they wish to do so).
    
-   **What:** Describe *“What you want to learn?”* and *“How do you hope to apply and share your knowledge?”*
    
-   **How Much:** Please share the cost of the initiative so we can track overall spend.
    

  

After you press **“submit”**, the Slack Workflow will send you a **confirmation message** with the following information:

-   If in **3 working days** there are no objections, your proposal will pass, and Liuba will proceed with the payment.
    
-   Please feel free to **tag any other people** in the team you would like to be aware of your decision.
    

  

### I am done with my learning. “Now I have to “Give something Back”

  

An important part of nurturing our Vizz community is about being generous with our knowledge, skills and information so we can all benefit from it.

  

There are 2 ways you will be encouraged to share back so we can all grow at Vizz:

  

 **1. “Applying Learnings and/or Sharing Knowledge”:**
    
 Ideally all learning experiences should be conducive to new ways of being, thinking, working, etc. We believe it's fair to assume all learning should provide “some added value” to you and/or Vizz. 

 If you managed to do a good self reflection earlier on in the process (*What you want to learn? How do you hope to apply and share knowledge?*), this element should be part, and a natural extension, of your learning experience, and therefore your team’s growth and evolution.

As we will all be learning different things, **we don't want to be prescriptive in regards to what you need to do, or how to do it, when it comes to applying or sharing your learnings.**

In other words, we won't be imposing on you to do a lightning talk, write a blog, deliver a workshop, improve a process or create a new tool, as that would limit your possibilities and creativity to create impact and apply your learnings.
   

> Please feel free to apply your learnings and share knowledge as you
> see best fit in your role, team and/or Vizz.

    

**2. “I will use this as part of my own annual review”.**
    
You should also remember to give something back to yourself.
    
The things you learn and give back to the team may form an important part of your next self reflection so make sure you make note of the outcomes of your learning.
    

  

## Can you explain the 1500 Euros?

  

First of all, we are moving from 1300 (2021 allowance) Eur to 1500 Eur allowance per person per year.

  

One reason for this increase is to include within the allowance some budget to cover the hours you will spend learning (along with the cost of the training). By doing this we are responding to a need expressed by the team (“Does this budget include time for learning?”). Another reason for the increase is to also "expand" the scope of the training budget to include topics such as volunteering, innovation projects, etc.

  

So, when thinking and planning your Training Budget you should now think of both how much it will cost (ie. cost of the course) and also how many hours you are planning to spend learning (if needed/applicable).

  

*How much does the hour cost?* We explored a few ideas, and to keep things simple for now, we want to propose a **flat rate of 50 Eur per hour**. For Example:

  

-   The course I want to do costs: **500 Eur**
    
-   I will spend 10 hours studying: 10 hrs x 50 Eur = **500 Eur.**
    
-   Total Cost (Course + Hours): **1000 Eur**
    
-   Remainder Allowance: **500 Eur.**
    

  

*Is the “Give Back” time included in the 1500 Eur allowance?* 
No. As the “Give Back” element is very personal and will vary depending on what you are learning and how you want to apply you won't have to discount this time from your allowance.

  

**Is the learning time supposed to happen during working hours?* what happens if all the time spent learning is outside working hours?*

As with a lot of things in this proposal, we will trust your judgement so you can make the best possible decision for yourself and Vizz.

As you have gone through the process (self reflection, alignment, proposal), we would start always with the assumption that the learning is BOTH valuable to your team as well as your own growth. Based on this “mutual value”, it will then be your choice whether to count the time you spend learning as work hours (regardless of when it is) and if you do so, then also apply the 50EUR/hr.

And if training happens outside working hours, of course you don't have to track the hours.

  

## Will this process be forever?

I don't think so, and we hope you can help us improve it and refine it by using it and providing feedback.

  

## Any questions?

  

If you have any doubts about this guideline, please feel free to reach out to People & Culture.

# Creating Use Cases

## Useful for. 
Getting the client to think a bit more about how the tool will be used and the impacts we want to generate from different audiences using the tool. It should also help them prioritise th must haves with the nice to haves. 

## How to do it. 
This should build on a discussion about personas. Do that first before this. Each use case has a certain structure: “As a [insert persona name], I want to [action to perform on site], in order to [objective they want to achieve]”. Give everyone 5-6 post it notes, and 5 minutes to think through the most important use cases (for them). We’ll then go round the table and ask everyone to present, in turn, what they’ve put. Where we have similar post-its, we can group them together as they’re presented. We can then do a round of voting to see which use cases are most important for us to focus on. 

**A good example.** I2I workshop [see pics here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBMmdTNU1oWEdFWjQ)
**Time needed.** 45 minutes. 5 minutes to set up, 5 minutes thinking, 20 minutes presenting and grouping, 15 minutes voting/ prioritising. 

# Introduction

Team spirit is essential for the close working of our team. Being able to trust each other, speak frankly about difficult topics, support each other through good and bad: all of that needs an investment of time and soul. Having a distributed team - across three offices and many co-working or remote locations - can make it even more difficult to build and maintain that.

This guideline describes and formalises staff ability to move around and visit other offices.

## Onboarding

When we hire someone in the Porto or Cambridge office, the starter's buddy should discuss and assess with the members of the team with whom they will work if it would be useful to arrange a trip to the main office in Madrid. Typical goals of this trip are for the new starter to meet the wider team they will be working with, to introduce them to the way we work, and to start building that trust and shared understanding that will make our work go quickly and efficiently. The accommodation and travel is paid for by the company in this case.

If you are a remote worker starting out at the company, we might ask that you spend your first few months working from one of our offices for the same reasons. When this happens the company pays you a relocation bonus for the duration of your stay.
[note: after consenmentisation, we’ll need to update the onboarding guideline to include this]

## Vizzcamp

Every year we will have a two-three day retreat: a time for us all to get together and have some time to talk about the future of Vizzuality. This usually involves traveling to a location just outside Madrid and staying there for 1-2 nights. This is all covered by Vizzuality.

## Christmas Party.

Every year, usually in the second or third week of December, we hold our Christmas Party in Madrid. While the party usually takes place on a Friday night, you’re welcome to come and stay for the whole week prior if you have relevant work to do that will benefit from being all together in Madrid. In previous years we’ve run training workshops, end-of-year retrospectives, reviews and discussions to plan for the next year in this period.

## Trips for projects.

In most cases travel for project work should be covered by a project’s budget. Any team writing a proposal should consider the potential geographic spread of their team and whether a sprint may be necessary; if yes, then make sure these expenses are included in the proposal.

We appreciate that sometimes a need arises organically within a project to arrange a sprint where people from different offices meet in one place. In that case, where there hasn’t necessarily been a budget allocated at the start of the project, follow these steps.

* Evaluate the benefits of that sprint - how much difference will it make to the project? If there isn’t a measurable increase in code quality/ speed of work/etc, it would count as ‘travel for other reasons’.
* Consult with Laura about the profitability of that project - is there spare budget available to perform this sprint (especially if it generates a ‘saving’ because of increased speed or quality of output).
* Get estimates for the cost of the travel (accommodation at €100 a night per person and flights with priority boarding). Ideally you should be planning this travel at least 6 weeks ahead of time, so we can book it at least a month in advance to make the most of cheaper prices.
* Weigh up the cost of travel vs the impact on project profitability and decide, with Laura and Liuba, whether to go or not. If your request is very close to the planned event (i.e. less than 2 weeks) you may find that we can’t secure reasonably priced tickets or accommodation in time.

## Travel for other reasons.

If you want to go and work from Porto, Cambridge, Madrid, or with one of our remote workers, then of course you’re welcome to do that. Vizzuality will not recompense you for any trip you make that isn’t directly related to projects. Before you book, you should check with the staff in the host office that there is a space for you, just in case there is a project workshop or event going on that will make it difficult to receive you in that office. Probably there won’t be!

# What needs to be true

## Useful for. 
Exploring the objectives of the client and how the website helps them meet their objectives. Trying to work out the value we’re providing with each feature. 

## How to do it. 
Get a whiteboard/ large wall. Write out 1-2 key objectives on postits/ the whiteboard. Put them at the far end. Then start working backwards from there, always asking what needs to be true to achieve that. For example, if a goal is “every US secondary school kid interacts with this site”, it needs to be true that “it’s possible to recommend it for teachers” and “every school has technology needed to show the site”. And for those two things to be achieved, there are a lot of other things that need to be true. And so on and so on… It’s best to think of ‘barriers’ (things that will stop us achieving our goal) and ‘facilitators’ (things that will help us/ need to be in place in order to achieve a goal)

The idea is to keep going down the “what needs to be true”, to make sure our goals are achievable and identify any of the questions we need to ask in the coming weeks.

**A good example.** EarthPulse. [See notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I-GWdDT8bPWI90k21sYvvnvD55evHayTAAShC88HwsA/edit#heading=h.x7opgbfw3i0q)

**Time needed.** This will need at least an hour. 5 mins to set up the activity, then probably 20-30 minutes on each big objective (focus on 2, maybe 3 at most). 

#**Writing Proposals**

First of all, make sure you talk to Bernat, Craig or Jamie about the proposal you are writing, so they can add it to the pipeline. Post something in the #business-dev channel for the proposal team to talk about.

Then throw all the docs you have in a new folder [in our proposals folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bz9ghrEmlkpbS1p5RkhqdDJIaWc). Ask Jamie, Craig or David G. for permission if you don't have it. 

Take the RFP and create a short overview document, [following this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pyWsqQpKzPoUpD3IiHe3ZEao2ASmh6aUEnfxhquL4aU/edit). Then assemble a team to write it, using #proposals in Slack to coordinate. 

In the proposals folder in Google Drive you can find a number of examples of our previous proposals. We have quite a lot of boilerplate text, [which can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17YyO8Km30We5Invp3wEdZvzEIhX7EXUPCeTuPF0lLcA/edit#heading=h.pjjge9xxxj9p). This includes descriptions of some of our development principles, some text about our skills, project narratives and introduction to some staff.

We have a number of CVs ready to publish, depending on the needs of the client. CVs using the Europass template can be found in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxmLmgSmQaCGRUhndWQ0VF9MVTQ) (final versions in the 'cv annex' sub-folder) and in the World Bank/ UN template [can be found here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9iu7Qcff3aBODB1RW0zUDlaM0U)  

Once it's sent, move the card to 'sent' column in prosperworks. When we have written confirmation they want to move forward, move to 'happy to proceed'. We put it as “won” once contract is signed (and also move it to contract signed column).

#Advice on using Prosperworks
##A client asks for more features/ an extension towards the end of the project
Create a new card in solid idea with the source as continuation, and the contact details we already have on file.  
Make sure one of the BD team are aware (BM, CM, DG, JG, SE)

##Meet someone in a conference that seems like a potential client 
Add them to PW as a lead, tag them with a conference tag (e.g. UNWDF)
Use the source “presentation”
If there is a clear and obvious opportunity straight away, convert them to a contact and add an opportunity to that contact.

##A hello email comes in with a potential lead
Add person as a lead, select hello@ as the source. Suggest follow up call to qualify if it appears serious.
After call and if serious, convert to contact, add opportunity, stick opportunity in “Solid Idea”
If there is an alternative source (e.g. marketing) use that over the hello@

##We delivered a project months ago and now they want more
Open the champagne
Spray on craig
Create a new card in solid idea with the source as continuation, and the contact details we already have on file.  
Make sure one of the BD team are aware (CM, DG, JG, AJ, SE) and set up a call with client to discuss next steps. 

##Source types
Presentation - Staff give a presentation, someone introduces themselves with a potential opportunity.

Internal Referral - One department recommends us to another department

External Referral - We are recommended by a client to a different external client

Continuation - Extension or new phase of an existing project

Repeat - Same client, different project

Hello@ - Source unknown, came through hello email.

Marketing Effort - “I saw your work in x,  can you do something for me” - this needs to be accompanied with a tag to the marketing action

Cold RFP - we see something on the web/ someone shares with us and we give it a go. 


##Definitions of each section of the Sales Pipeline.

Idea. An opportunity that although is likely to happen, it’s not quite ready for action (e.g. waiting for RFP or funding). This may also be an idea that originates from us that needs testing.

Solid Idea. This is the queue proceeding some kind of action, whether that’s a proposal that needs writing or a pitch. We will review this queue each week to see what pending work from the BD team.

Writing Proposal. This is when work is actually getting done on a proposal or pitch. It sits in here when we’re full go go go on trying to win the work.

Proposal Sent. We’ve delivered a proposal or pitch to the client, now we are waiting for a response. When you move the card here, make sure to update the start and end date that we proposed - this helps Laura calculate projected cash flow. You should also think about the win % - more info on that below.

Nothing else to do here apart from maybe prompt the client if it’s taking a while. Sometimes they may ask for a further round of work in which case the opp goes back in the writing proposal pile.

Happy to proceed. We’ve had verbal or email confirmation that we have won the work. The action once it’s in this pile is to sort the contract.

Contract Signed. Only once we have a contract signed by both parties does the opportunity card move into this pile. At this point we also change the status to “Won”

Contract Finished. Once the contract is complete and the final invoice paid.

##Win percentages
Each card has a win percentage. These should evolve to reflect 1) how likely we are to actually win it and 2) the range of error around a budget. Each column has a default win % (as below) reflecting our experience so far. You don’t have to worry about win % until you move a card to proposal sent. Use this guide to work out what % you think your card should get. 
100% - only once we get a contract
90% - we’ve been given a written yes

# **Yes and.**

## Useful for.
Thinking of creative or innovative ways to deliver a certain feature. 

## How to do it. 
Using the results of the [what content activity](content.md), you should have a set of features/ contents that should be on the site. Split them amongst a couple of small groups (2-3 people each) and then run the activity. Put the feature/ content as a postit at the top of a wall/ whiteboard. Then, between the 2 or 3 of you, extend that idea by saying “yes and…”. 

EG if a feature is “Impact visualisation”, the yes ands could be 
- “yes and it’s built with the New York Times datavizz team for mass exposure”
- “yes and it’s added to giphy so people can share an animation of it”
- "yes and we find ways to incorporate that data into other Vizzuality projects for the biggest reach possible"

**A good example.** [Mozilla](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBUzhGVGJqdmVnM28)

**Time needed.** As long as you need. In the Mozilla workshop we spent 5 minutes setting up, 30 minutes in groups (3 features each to do yes and with), then an hour presenting and discussing.
